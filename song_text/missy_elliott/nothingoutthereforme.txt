[Beyonce]
Ooh

[Missy]
Beyonce! I know you ain't letting that broke down insecure L.L. Cool J wanna be nigga keep you in the house for another Friday.

[Beyonce]
Just..Just go ahead I'ma stay here wit my man. Ain't notin out there for me.

My man don't like my friends
(Girl your man ain't no good why he tryin to keep you in?)
He says they influence me
(If I was an influence Id'a been said leave)
But boy I love him so
(Girl we late for the club, why you still don't wanna roll?)
Cuz I got my prize right here
(But see the guys at the party!)

[Chorus]
Ain't nothing out there for me
Ain't nothing about there for me
This is where I wanna be
I dun already been in the streets
And I aint came across nothin' so sweet
He's the only man that I love
And I don't need more than one
So don't worry when I'm hanging out
He's the only one that I am thinking about!

I know he's insecure
Everytime I leave out the door
(and you letting him spoil your night? Live your life, you aint even his wife)
He ain't gotta worry about me
Cus I got something more sweet
(Oh you must got a diamond ring)
And I know I'm so lucky
Aint nothin'

[Chorus]
Ain't nothing about there for me
This is where I wanna be
I dun already been in the streets
And I aint came across nothin' so sweet
He's the only man that I love
And I don't need more than one
So don't worry when I'm hanging out
He's the only one that I am thinking about!

And I love him
He's my baby for sure
I a sure him that
I love him more than ever before
And he don't bore me and his love like the time that we met
I adore him
And no man has come closer than that
[repeat]

[Chorus]
Ain't nothing out there for me
Ain't nothing about there for me
This is where I wanna be
I dun already been in the streets
And I aint came across nothin' so sweet
 He's the only man that I love
And I don't need more than one
So don't worry when I'm hanging out
He's the only one that I am thinking about!

Go ahead I'ma stay here with my man
Ain't nothing out there for me

Now is your sure about that?

What part don't you understand? 
Yeah I'm sure about that
I think you should really go

Make sure you sure about that

Cus my man is all I love
Yeah I'm sure about that
Don't let him blow your high
Go out and have a nice time
Now is ya sure about that?
Girl I do not get high, and with him I spend all my time
Yeah I'm sure about that
Ok stay wit your man ill be at the club doing my dance...

Oh..
