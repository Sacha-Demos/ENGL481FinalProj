Like yo name is Missy Elliott
My name is Fantasia Barrino
And what I can give you

Holla at ya girl

[Shouted-Missy]
2005
Wooh!

[Verse 1-Missy (Fantasia)]
Wake up in the morning with my man next to me
Up all night like we on that extacy
Mix with that hennessy 
He got the remedy, yeah my nigga into me
Can't say ya simply we
Take a quick shower for the hour conversation
Time to have relations
Love making in the basement
Smack it for the pressure (ooooohhhh yeah)
One minute, two minute, I was no questions
Who would ever think that I'd be giving up the goodies
Walk around naked in a pair of pink footies
Just like them hos at the shows
Half-dressed clothes, doing whatever who knows
Okay (okay)
Nah I only get freaky wit him
No menag¨ trois, not freaky with him
Its just me and my man
Simply me and my man

[Chorus-Fantasia]
For my man, I'd do whatever
Cause what I feel, this love it make me do things, make me do things
For my man, my loves forever, my loves forever
Cause what I feel, this love it won't ever change 

[Verse 2-Missy & Fantasia]
I'm never insecure when we're not together
Even though he told me he in love with Ciara
I'm from a new era and I bring terror to ay chick who check my fella when we together
So he treat me like Cinderella
Protect me from the storm like he my umbrella
This fella deserve from a stella
He be a Rockefeller, not Jay-Z and Dame
But the charm on a chain
He platinum (oooh)
Jacob Rolly lick his Forty (He packin)
He stackin, keep trackin and I'll fax em
If I can't find his ass then his ass outta gas
He only getting one past (Okaaay!)
Cuz my man (my man) he's my man and he nobody else's
Damn right
I've never felt this
Old ladies trying to coast us 
You better get focus before you ever try to approach him

[Chorus-Fantasia]
For my man, I'd do whatever
Cause what I feel, this love it make me do things, make me do things
For my man, my loves forever, my loves forever
Cause what I feel, this love it won't ever change 

[Verse 3-Missy (Fantasia)]
See when you in love you might have to fight
Don't ever say you won't (ever say you won't)
You might get real mad
Wanna act all bad
Act up in the street, few chicks ya gotta beat cause the disrespect
Clockin ya man from his feets to his neck
Uh!
You gotta let her know that's a no-no
Slap her real slow with her right blow
Whichever way you go and keep it gangsta (gangsta)
Show these bitches that aint gon (aint gon)
Yank a point, blank a top, rank her
I ride for my nigga and I'm happy with the trigger
Scared how you figure?
My man
Said time again that's my man (my man)
My man again, I say that's my man (that's my maaan!)
Its just me and my man, simply me and my man

[Chorus-Fantasia]
For my man, I'd do whatever
Cause what I feel, this love it make me do things, make me do things
For my man, my loves forever, my loves forever
Cause what I feel, this love it won't ever change 

[Outro-Fantasia]
That's my man!
Yes! That's my man!
This love!
Ohhhhhhh!
