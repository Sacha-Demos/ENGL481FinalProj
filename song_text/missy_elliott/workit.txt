DJ, please pick up your phone
I'm on the request line

This is a Missy Elliott one-time exclusive 
Come on

Is it worth it, let me work it
I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it
I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it [backwards 2x]
If you got a big ***, let me search you
And find out how hard I gotta work you
I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it [backwards 2x]

I'd like to get to know you so I could show you
Put the pussy on you like I told you
Gimme all your numbers so I could phone you
Your girl actin' stank then call me over

Not on the bed, lay me on your sofa
Phone before you come, I need to shave my chocha
You do or you don't or you will or won't you
Go downtown and eat it like a vulture

See my hips and my tips, don't you?
See my ass and my lips, don't you?
Lost a few pounds and my waist for you
This the kinda beat that go ra-ta-ta
Ra-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta
Sex me so good I say blah-blah-blah
Work it, I need a glass of water
Boy, oh, boy, it's good to know you

Is it worth it, let me work it
I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it
I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it [backwards 2x]
If you got a big ***, let me search you
And find out how hard I gotta work you
I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it [backwards 2x]

Come on

If you a fly gal get your nails done
Get a pedicure, get your hair did
Boy, lift it up, let's make a toast-a
Let's get drunk, that's gonna bring us closer
Don't I look like a Halle Berry poster?
See the Belvedere playin' tricks on you

Girlfriend wanna be like me, never
You won't find a bitch that's even better
I make you hot as Las Vegas weather
Listen up close while I take it backwards
Watch the way Missy like to take it backwards [backwards]

I'm not a prostitute, but I could give you what you want
I love your braids and your mouth full of floss
Love the way my ass go bum-bum-bum-bum
Keep your eyes on my bum-bum-bum-bum-bum
And think you can handle this gadong-a-dong-dong
Take my thong off and my ass go vroom
Cut the lights on so you see what I could do

Is it worth it, let me work it
I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it
I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it [backwards 2x]
If you got a big ***, let me search you
And find out how hard I gotta work you
I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it [backwards 2x]

Come on

Boys, boys, all type of boys
Black, white, Puerto Rican, Chinese boys
Why-thai-thai-o-toy-o-thai-thai
Rock-thai-thai-o-toy-o-thai-thai

Girls, girls, get that cash
If it's 9 to 5 or shakin' your ass
Ain't no shame, ladies, do your thing
Just make sure you ahead of the game

Just 'cause I got a lot of fame super
Prince couldn't get me change my name papa
Kunta Kinte a slave again, no sir
Picture black sayin', "Oh, yes a master."

Picture Lil' Kim dating a pastor
Minnie Me and Big Ren can out last ya
Who was the best, I don't have to ask ya
When I come out you won't even matter

[Music video verse:]
Got a Lamborghini so I drive faster
Just makin' hating people freakin' matter
Admit I'm the f****** name won the battle
When I drop this record here you won't even matter

Why you act dumb like "Uh, duh"
So you act dumb like "Uh, duh"
As the drummer boy go ba-rom-pop-pom-pom
Give you some-some-some of this Cinnabun

Is it worth it, let me work it
I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it
I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it [backwards 2x]
If you got a big ***, let me search you
And find out how hard I gotta work you
I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it [backwards 2x]

Come on

To my fellas
I like the way you work that
To my ladies
You sure know how to work that
