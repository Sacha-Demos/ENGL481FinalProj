Music... 

WOOO 

When I walk up in the club, they be pushin' 
Misdemeanor got that ice that keep'em lookin' 
(Uh-huh) 
Crop top, drop tops on my Phantom, mang. 
They be trippin' and them haters just pussies. 
(Woo) 

Feelin' on me, feelin' on me like a pornstar, 
I drive a fast car, still shave my chocha. 
(Uh-huh) 
Get the cash, get the cheddar, get the beans mean, 
(Uhhh) 
Ching-a-ling, bling bling, my money real green 

[CHORUS] 
Who dat? 
Who dat? 
Player better fall back, 
st-step back, player better fall back. 
Click-Clack, cock back 
Semi-automatic track 
Drink a lot of Similac, 
Shorty better fall back. 

(WOO) 
I fall down, get up 
then I gotta dust it off 
(Uh-huh) 
(Say you got to dust it off?) 
Yeah, I quickly dust it off. 
I'm off the wall, 
I do brawl, don't stall 
Yes it's on, 
Said it's on, I can't be cloned 
You can call me Mike Jones. 

305-212-804, My cell 
(WOO) 
Y'all must be dumb as hell 
If y'all think that is my cell. 

Hotel, motel, Holiday- 
Don't play- 
round the way, OJ 
Yeah, I'm so icey. 
(AAH) 

What them haters say? 
Misdemeanor OK. 
(Uh) 
Call me foreplay, 
Position more than 40 ways. 
(Uh-huh) 
Like a chocolate glaze, 
I'm hotter than a summer day. 
Stingray, Sugar Ray, 
Knuckles all up in your face. 

[CHORUS] 

I block-a block-a, 
Straight jocker, 
Matter fact, a face snapper. 
Money stacker, no slacker, 
Hit rapper, gun strapper. 
I click, click 
hear my-- 
Click-click. 

2 snaps, you hit, then I-- 
click-click. 
I make cash, pay them bills, 
I pay them bills that buy new wheels. 
I wear high heels, 
I touch and feel, 
catch me in your man grill. 

My record deal, my movie deal 
Is super sick-sick. 
I click-click, and if you doubt me then I-- 
Click - click. 
(Uh-huh) 

Smack them boys, 
I will destroy- 
Hit, hit, straight down and 
split-split ya boy. 

I kick-kick like Karate flick-flicks 
You get your ass bit, 
Don't make me have to- 
Click-click 

[CHORUS] 

[FADE]
