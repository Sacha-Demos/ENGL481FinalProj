[Missy]
Uhhhh
Ah!

Have you ever been in the mind of a virgin?
It gets hot and curious (And ooaaa)
Well let me take you there
Are you ready, boy?
Come on baby, strap up, 'cause it might get serious (uh ooaaa!)
Now there will be some heat and some friction
Don't get alarmed 'cause I'll put ice just to chill the night (I'm just being polite)
And I want to see if you're into it
Intimate kisses and huggings so sentiment (oh!)
With you I might wanna spend my life

[Chorus:]
You make the freak come up out me
That's what I'm talkin' about
Go 'head like it's my birthday
That-that's what I'm talking about
You make me say oooaa! 'til I can't speak
That's what I'm talkin' about
Baby that-that's what I'm talking bout
That-that's what I'm talkin' about
You don't know just what you do, yeah
That's what I'm talkin' about
When I'm rocking, slow dance with you
That-that's what I'm talking about
'cause you put chills on my arm when we kiss, yeah
That's what I'm talkin' about
Baby that-that's what I'm talking about
That-that's what I'm talking about..
ALRIGHT!

[R. Kelly]
Now all I wanna do is, baby
Is make your dove cry and make your body scream like
AH!
Bet your bottem dollar
Can make you believe that you can fly (Yeah)
Well, one hit of this sex weed
Guaranteed to get you high
Like a mother for you (No, baby)
You won't even know what day it is
'cause after I come from downtown
Girl I'ma wanna go another round, yeah
Until you tell me Kell's please stop
Put it like this
It's like fresh up out the kitchen
The way I got your oven so hot, mama
I'm hit from the back, and the front, then the side, then bounce it up
and down like this
And baby, everyone's gonna say you're a pimp
'cause I'ma have you walking with a limp

[Chorus]

[BRIDGE: Missy]
Sex me, like me
Kiss me, hold me
Touch me, feel me
Do me baby, yea

Cause..
Sex me, like me
Kiss me, hold me
Touch me, feel me
Do me baby, yea
[R. Kelly:] This is the greatest bridge I ever heard

ALRIGHT!

Yea, for shizzle my nizzle
you show enough the dizzle
And that's on the rizzle, oh
Boy, you feel me sizzle (feel me sizzle)
So sweet helped me do almost anything

[CHORUS 2 w/ad-libs]
