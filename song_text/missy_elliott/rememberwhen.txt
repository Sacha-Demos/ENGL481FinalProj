Baby, it's not true
When they say all men are dogs.
Cuz I know alot of women who cheat.
I know you kinda wondering
Why I'm having this conversation with you,
Cuz I speak upon expierence.
And if was worth anything
I'll never cheat again.

Know I may act stubborn boy
But that dont mean I dont love you boy
Please forgive me for my attitude
When it seems like im takin all my shit out on you
I know I never said this here
Lemme make myself loud and clear
I appreciate the way you treat me
I've done a lot of things you still don't hate me

[CHORUS]
Remember when you caught me cheatin (cheatin)
You said I stopped your heart from breathin (stopped ya hearttt) (breathin)
But you loved me so you forgave me (gave me)
When you coulda ran out and played me (played me)

Am I a dissappointment- to ya baby
Most of the time im wrong
Makin' excuses for the abuses I've done, stepping all on your heart
But ya never let me baby, say im sorry all the time
Any other guy would be gone but you stay hear right by my side

[CHORUS]

And the love like this
I cant play no games
Cuz its hard to forgive it
But you didnt neva complain
Neva rub it in my face- juss lemme slide on by
I know every girl- wish she had you as a guy

No no no no- no nooo no
Cuz a love like thi
Cant play no games
And its hard to forgive I did to you
Lemme slide on by
Yea

[rap]...
When I cheated you said you couldnt breathe (said you couldnt breathe)
Now im sitting here beggin on my knees
Take me back, I'll do anything including please
I didnt mean to burn a bridge third degree
Like fantasia said let yourself be free
The truth be, without me you'll succeed
Im sorry baby please believe in you and me
C'mon

Aint no love better than you
With all the pain I put you through
?
Without you here what would I do [x2]
