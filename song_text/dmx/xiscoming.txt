1, 2, X is coming for you
3, 4, better lock your door
5, 6, get your crucifix
7, 8, don't stay up late

1, 2, X is coming for you
3, 4, better lock your door
5, 6, get your crucifix
7, 8, don't stay up late

Who's afraid of the dark?
Responsible for the murders in the park
When I bark, they hear the boom, but you see the spark
And I seen the part of your head which used to be your face
Was replaced by nothing for bluffing, what a waste
Niggas wanna see me taste my own medicine, picture that
Get on some old second grade shit, I'ma get you back
Retaliate, if it hates for you to think I took a loss
When all I did was shook it off
Yeah, you heard me, shook it off
Man, if we was up north, niggas would have been fucked you
But then we in the streets, niggas should haven been stuck you
Plucked you like a chicken wit' your head cut off
They'll find you wit' your back open and your legs cut off
And as for your man, don't you ever in your mothafuckin' life
Know when I gotta gun come at me wit' a knife, a'ight?
And forgetting you ever saw me is the best thing to do
Don't give a fuck about your family, they'll be resting with you

[Hook x2]

You got yourself in a predicament, that you can't get out of
You already in some shit, but it's about to get hotter
Fucking with a nigga like you running your mouth
Will, have that same nigga like you, gun in your mouth
But won't be like the last time when you run in the house
Cause I ain't knocking on the door
I'm coming in the house
And I'm gunning for your spouse, trying to send the bitch back to her maker
And if you got a daughter older then 15, I'ma rape her
Take her on the living room floor, right there in front of you
Then ask you seriously, whatchu wanna do?
Frustrating, isn't it? When they kill me, but I'ma kill you
Now watch me fuck just a little while longer, please, will you?
This is revenge, no time before you die
And despite how much I hate to see a grown man cry
I'ma make you suffer, see your ass in Hell, Motherfucker, click, boom-boom
See your ass in hell

[Hook x2]

When I speak you better listen, the harder it gets, the more follows
And I'm hitting them with shit that they can't all swallow
I keep my slugs hollow, keep families with sorrow
Keep motherfuckers like you, not seeing tomorrow
I will borrow a gun, then run 'til I catch you
Let you slip up, just once, then I'ma wet you
Stretch you out like a limousine
Cause where I catch you is where I catch you, that's what killing means
Fuck whoever's standing there when you get what you got coming
Cause once I hit you in your head, the witnesses start running
Niggas started something, but they chose not to finish it
So I'ma wrap it up, for real, dog, cause I'ma winner, shit
Fuck it yo, let's end this shit, I don't need the plaques
And I ain't a DJ, nigga, so I don't need the wax
Gimme slugs from my gats
Gimme hoods from my rats
Gimme wood from my bats
Then they meet where the fuck I'm at, for real

[Hook x2]
