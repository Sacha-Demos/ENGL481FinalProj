[Intro:]
808 Mafia
Cozy boys

[Chorus - Waka Flocka & A$AP Rocky:]
Car from overseas with four pipes
Met her in the club, I'm a fuck tonight
All my niggas felons, damn right
Nigga what you selling? That all white
I can't forget that off swipe
Snow white in my frostbite
Whipping and pitching that powder
Whipping it harder, give it a short price
She fuck with me then she alright
A$AP yelling for life
All my niggas rep Brick Squad
Fuck around and it's on sight

[Verse 1 - Waka Flocka Flame:]
I'm selling records while my dogs cooking
I'm rocking shows while you catch a plug
Fuck niggas, show em now love
And police, they can eat a slug
Cop killers give em hollow tips
Them bullets burn, I'm a rider bitch
Rental cars, hop out of it
RIP to the opposites

[Verse 2 - A$AP Rocky:]
To the hating hoes, tell em ride a dick
White hoes love chocolate
Pretty Flacko and Flocka bitch
All eyes on me, 2Pacalypse
Might drive a Benz then cop a six
Drive a six then drop this shit
A year ago niggas was drinking Spades
Flacko home and he popping Cris
Nigga fuck pussy boys

[Verse 3 - Waka Flocka Flame:]
I don't believe in hoes, breaking backs
Pulling hair, girl throw it back
Real nigga bust a bottle, throw a stack
Fuck a hater bitches like I'm Goldie Mack

[Bridge - A$AP Rocky:]
Watch these niggas gon hate
And watch my niggas gon spray
And watch these bitches gon shake
If they watch these figures I make
I said, watch these niggas gon hate
And watch my niggas gon spray
And watch these bitches gon shake
If they watch these figures I make
