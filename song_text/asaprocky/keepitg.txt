[Verse 1:]
This is music for the villains, sophisticated cheering
ASAP in the house, now we're finna run the building
Working never chilling 'til I get a million
To the ceiling, now my niggas gunning for a billion
They ask me how I'm livin, I say I'm gold grillin
Niggas acting different, motherfuck a friendship
These bitches is persistent, talking about I'm distant
Lost my mind a long time ago to find it, need forensics
For instance, I get-get my dick licked
Red bone, complexion like a piglet, kiss-kiss
Fuck Ace, we sip Cris, afford it because I'm getting it
Drip-drip, the thought of it is ignorant, isn't it?
I'm ticklish, stunting is my business
Swagging on you hoes and I'm shitting on you niglets
So little homie, peep game
Cause these other rappers lame and don't care to do the same

[Hook:]
(Hey, young blood) Stay true to the game
Fuck them lames, keep it motherfucking G
(Hey, young blood) Nigga I'm a tell you
Like a motherfucking G told me
(Hey, young blood) Stay true to yourself
Everyday, low-motherfucking-key
(Hey, young blood) Cause at the end of the day
Fuck what you say, nigga I'm going to be it G

[Verse 2:]
Well let me tell you about a nigga like me
I be smoking, choking, black locing with the OE
She wants to take a dick ride, we slide
Straight to the telly, shaking her jelly with my dick inside
Hit it in motion, in slow motion, hit it
Nigga, she's open, nigga I'm poking, split it
With it, get it right there in the bed
Open up your legs, let me beat that pussy red
Fuck what you said, I'm a still do me
Groupies, be sucking and fucking, porno movie
Do we have a problem in here
Look a nigga in the eye as I notice the fear
I am severe, my style is hella sharp, like a spear
All I do is sit back and think with a 40 beer
And you gotta feel the funk
While the bass plays loud booming all in your damn trunk

[Hook]
