[Verse 1]
Feelin out of place, plus its gettin kinda late
Tryna make it home safe, and I get raped. Where you live?
Tina tummy ache, Gina got the funny face
Mona's sniffin dope, so Odoma's leanin' on the rib
I bet you wish you had a Benz cause you just helped you friends
Flag a taxi. Now you walkin not too far from your crib
Cravin for an acid tablet for your satisfaction
Said you feelin flabbergasted you just had to have it
Made your way to 7th ave. Flagged a yellow cab
Now you need an upper fast to help your mellow swag
Black kid french braids and he keep it potent?
Hold ya purse don't trust him cause his teeth is golden
Dice rollin' reefer blowin in the streets he smokin
Blowin weed while police patrollin
Acid strips, purple drink you can have a sip
Have a fix of this acid drip

[Hook x2]
Hand on the dial kiss on the lips
Eye for an eye drip for a drip
I getcha high please don't forget
I can supply the fix for ya drip
