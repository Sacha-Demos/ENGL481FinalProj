[Hook]
Let me know, know what's up
Before I roll, roll one up

I been rollin up that reefer got me high
I been rollin up that weed, it got me high
I been rollin up sativa got me high
I been rollin all week, it got me high

[Verse 1]
Puff puff pass take a drag just don't steam it tho
Smokin on that captain kush this shit is unbelievable
My shit come from Mexico, yeah I got that ino
Mama said leave weed alone but I think I need it oh oh
Niggas gettin throwed, oh oh
We blowin purple smoke, oh oh
The kush and purple haze, oh oh
We flyin paper planes
Cause I'm always talkin fly shit fashion be the topic
That's why all these hoes wanna hop and jump on my dick
Then she looked at me and said how lower can yo eyes get?
Lemme know who's trippin in this before I cop it

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Rotation is like basketball blunts is goin back and forth
Niggas mixin hash and dro with cinnamon thats applesauce
Sho dis what you askin for liqour is my last resort
Steamin niggas grab the torch then puff puff pass it off
Uh and tell me what you think about it
I been gettin high I'm tryna get a drink around it
Now my high is higher than it's ever been
I'm so mothafuckin' high I think I might never land
They be talkin crazy but I been rollin hazeys up
I been havin like a 20 40 then that 80 bucks
Man I come through get that Mercedes drunk and them ladies fuck
They already know we got them blunts and we blazin up

[Hook]
