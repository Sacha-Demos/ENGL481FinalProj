A couple more commas richer,
And I'm still mobbin with my niggas bruh.
That's why they don't like us rollin deep to the club nigga,
Fuck ya club nigga!
Wherever I'm at is the club nigga, suck a dick
Swag Swag
ASAP.

[Verse 1:]
Toot that shoot that glock nine,
Jiggy nigga I'm bout mine,
Pinky ring and my watch shine,
Yo bitch callin my hotline.

Wide buggy look cockeyed,
Big pockets sit lopside,
Talk studpid get your mouth wired,
We bout it bout it and rowdy huh.

Bitches all on my jock huh,
Pretty nigga might stop time,
Told ya'll young niggas runnin shit,
Including red lights and stop signs.

Asap niggas on the scene ha,
Young trill niggas on my team ha,
Servin fiends ha, bitches scream ha,
See the beam ha, it's the ninaa.

[Chorus:]
Rocky where you been,
I've been thuggin with my team hoe.
Rocky how you been
I've been thuggin with my team hoe.
Rocky where you been,
I've been thuggin with my team hoe.
Rocky how you been
I've been thuggin with my team hoe.

[Verse 2]
My trunk shake, and my paint spill,
Chrome [?] with the grain wheel.
Puss pussy niggas they ain't tril,
And we toast to ricky cause he ain't chere.

A couple bad bitches everyday chill,
So much snow you need a reindeer,
Thuggish ruggish like st. clair,
Trill bitches want to hop up on the thang yeaa.

[Chorus]

A young nigga, a young blood,
A mane don't let these niggas box you in my nigga
Just cause you get rich don't forget where you came from
Or who you really are man
