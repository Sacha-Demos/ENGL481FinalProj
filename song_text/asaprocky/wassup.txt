[Hook 1:]
See me in the hood the gangsters saying wassup (Wassup) Heey
See me in the hood the gangsters saying wassup (Wassup) Heey

[Verse 1: Rocky]
Back once again sippin henn mixed with juice and gin
Bitches in, couple lady friends countin Benjamins
Spinners spin, on the 20-twins that Mercedes-Benz
Dividends made a change of plans well that all depends
Shout-out my parolees and I smoke that OG
Kush mother fuck the police, all my niggas rock gold teeth
So hood and we so street, sippin on that codeine
We hustle hard no sleep, your bitch loose that's no leash

[Bridge:]
I ain't talkin 'bout no money, I ain't talkin 'bout no cars
Talkin 'bout no diamonds cause that shit is a facade
Times is really hard, I fucked a couple broads
Smoked some purple out the jars, let me tell you who we are

[Hook 2:]
I be that pretty motherfucker, Harlem's what I'm repping
Tell em quit the bitchin, we gonna make it in a second
Pretty motherfucker, Harlem's what I'm repping
Tell em call the bitch and we gonna make it in a second

[Hook 1:]
See me in the hood the gangsters saying wassup (Wassup) [x2]
See me in the hood the gangsters saying wassup (Wassup) [x2]

[Verse 2: Rocky]
Pretty nigga in some shit you never hear of
Only thing bigger than my ego is my mirror
Clothes getting weirder
Money get longer, pretty nigga pin your hair up
The nerves with this dude but I'm cool as a vent
40 oz full of brew

[Hook 2:]
I be that pretty motherfucker, Harlem's what I'm repping
Tell em quit the bitchin, we gonna make it in a second
Pretty motherfucker, Harlem's what I'm repping
Tell em call the bitch and we gonna make it in a second

[Hook 2:]
I be that pretty motherfucker, Harlem's what I'm repping
Tell em quit the bitchin, we gonna make it in a second
Pretty motherfucker, Harlem's what I'm repping
Tell em call the bitch and we gonna make it in a second

[Hook 1:]
