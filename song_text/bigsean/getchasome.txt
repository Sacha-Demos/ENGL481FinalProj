You want my shoes?
You want my shirt?
My shoes too, nigga?

Boy, you need to go get ya some, go go get ya some, go get ya
Go get ya some, go go get ya some, go get ya
Go get ya some, go go get ya some, go get ya
Go get ya some, go go get ya some, go get ya

Fresh, fresh like I'm wrapped in plastic
Pull all the way to Gucci like, that's one fresh jacket
They looking at a nigga like, that's one fresh bastard
I'm rich bitch, see the shit that this cash get?
You can't afford the price so why the hell would you ask it?
These baggers try and snatch it, get they ass in a casket
Ya honey love me, she the mod of fashion
And I call her baby girl, just like her dad did
There's hundreds on my paper like a smart ass class get
Because I'm on top of my rap like an adlib
Ay you should holler mama, don't you hate cabana mama
Got a whole lot of mama, fifty and a prada

So you need to go get ya some, go go get ya some, go get ya
Go get ya some, go go get ya some, go get ya

But to get it boy you gotta be rich or something
And my entire hold old like my dick or something
I made more than ends meet
My nigga BIG told me it was 'bout the Benji's
I'm in the limelight 'till the point my skin green
I'm living my dreams 'till the point you should pinch me, convince me

Fresh, fresh like I'm wrapped in plastic
Pull all the way to Gucci like, that's one fresh jacket
They looking at a nigga like, that's one fresh bastard
I'm rich bitch, see the shit that this cash get?

You need to go get ya some, go go get ya some, go get ya
Go get ya some, go go get ya some, go get ya
Go get ya some, go go get ya some, go get ya
Go get ya some, go go get ya some, go get ya

If I told ya where to get it, you niggas still wouldn't grab it
Just to pronounce it, you gotta have the accent
And they ask it, can they call me grocery store
Cause my pockets full of paper and plastic
Man, you not affording my asian persuasion
Excuse a little life in your face, he stays bathing
And when the heat blaze on high beams
You scream, I scream for some cold ass ice cream

You need to go get ya some, go go get ya some, go get ya
Go get ya some, go go get ya some, go get ya
These bros thinking that they really gon' get them some
So they try to take care of me like I'm sick or something
There's some things I don't like
I love the Nikes but not the white on whites
Forget the price tags cause I get what I like
And your girl looking for me because she like the pipe, ya dig?

Fresh, fresh like I'm wrapped in plastic
Pull all the way to Gucci like, that's one fresh jacket
They looking at a nigga like, that's one fresh bastard
I'm rich bitch, see the shit that this cash get?

You need to go get ya some, go go get ya some, go get ya
Go get ya some, go go get ya some, go get ya
Go get ya some, go go get ya some, go get ya
Go get ya some, go go get ya some, go get ya

Dog, the fabric on my ass is satin
And they sad, you think you could afford this fabric?
When it come to the hoes, I'm the man like shaft is
Cause I'm clean cut and handle them like baggage
Atheist turned Christian when I rock my true religions
Dog, is that real when I'm rocking pastels
These niggas want to wonder what the hell I be
I'm sticking to my roots like LRG

Fresh, fresh like I'm wrapped in plastic
Pull all the way to Gucci like, that's one fresh jacket
They looking at a nigga like, that's one fresh bastard
I'm rich bitch, see the shit that this cash get?

You need to go get ya some, go go get ya some, go get ya
Go get ya some, go go get ya some, go get ya
Pose for the hoes, they might want to take a pic or something
Hop up in the ride, they might wanna let me stick or something
The rag 'round my neck compliment the outfit
I'm out with broads, you be watching from the couches
Man, I'm a need money, power, respect
Find a little piece of Jesus that I threw around my neck

Fresh, fresh like I'm wrapped in plastic
Pull all the way to Gucci like, that's one fresh jacket
They looking at a nigga like, that's one fresh bastard
I'm rich bitch, see the shit that this cash get?

You need to go get ya some, go go get ya some, go get ya
Go get ya some, go go get ya some, go get ya
Go get ya some, go go get ya some, go get ya
Go get ya some, go go get ya some, go get ya
