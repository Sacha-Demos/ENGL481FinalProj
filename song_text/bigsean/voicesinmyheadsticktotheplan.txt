Voices in my head sayin' I could do better
Voices in my head sayin' that I knew better
I done seen this shit happen a hundred times on the regular
But I still crossed the line like I'm blind (damn)
Voices in my head saying I could do better
You always do the same shit

This was supposed to be the last time
Last hit, last call, last feel, last trip, last run
That's what I always tell myself, huh
This was supposed to be the last one
Last two, last flip, last you, last me, last night
Doing every single thing my parents warned me about
'Til I wore 'em out (shit)

Voices in my head saying I could do better
(Voices in my head saying that I could do better)
Voices in my head saying that I knew better
I done seen this shit happen a hundred times on the regular
But I still (fuck)

Voices in my head, conscience talking to me like
Look
Stick to the plan
Stick to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
Stick to the plan, to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
Stick to the plan
Stay focused, don't let these niggas see your emotions
Stick to the notion, stay in motion
Remember soon as you stand still
So will everything else, you know this
Make sure all your inner actions end with actions
If you stacking frontin and back in
Subtract if it isn't adding
Plus who hurt you don't let back in
Plan it out, yeah tit for tat it
Extra pussy get distracting
Put that into what's worth having (boy)
Stick to the plan, stick to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
Stick to the plan, to the plan stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
Stick to the plan, stay focused
Pay attention who you getting close with
Distance yourself from negative energy
Voices in my head, they say it's meant for me

I, I, I, you in my way, bitch it's no sympathy
I, I, I, been plotting this since elementary
I, I, I, No you need to buckle down
Have people asking where you at
And wondering why you never wanna come around
You know the effort gon' come around
Big face like Zordon
You bought the watch but can't afford the time
Even if you running out of breath
Weight of the world doing lots of reps
Time to get this generation
Last one and then the next two outta debt
And they gon' pay you back with respect
Just stick to the plan
Still we can chill
Back when I rocked the white and blue Grant Hills
I realized there's no dream that I can't fill
I manifested all while I'm the man still
(Bitch I'm the man)
Voices in my head attacking what I'm thinking
Bullet to the head might be the way to free it
If I leave my body I can free the spirits
Swear to God my death of fear just keep on shrinking
Wishing I could go back to the nineties back when I was dreaming
Me and my dog was on a mission like we Kel and Kenan
Early 2000s Detroit might as well been the hell with demons
Wondering when I started it, the losing grip
Feeling like I'm in the middle of the ocean
You either drown or canoe through it
Voices in my head said I'm used to it
Some help me to lose and some help me maneuv through it
When I talk to myself I'm confused on who's who it
I know in life you either blow it or blew it
And at the end of life it's gonna feel like you flew through it
I just hope by then I cut the voices in my head
Voices in my head
