[Lil Yachty:]
You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
Cause it get cold like Minnesota, cold like Minnesota
Cold like Minnesota, cold like Minnesota
Need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
Cause it get cold like Minnesota, cold like Minnesota
Cold like Minnesota, it get cold like Minnesota
Need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat

[Playboi Carti:]
Cause it get cold like Minnesota
Pourin' in my soda
Park my lil sis on the corner
Cause she gettin' a little older
I was hustlin' down the [?]
And I fuck with robbers
Shady pop to the flat
Chi town bloods never foldin'
I remember in the night
Around summertime
Hittin' 86 on 25
Cause I know the world is mine
I was posted with my [?]
Trapping packs or the lines
Got some new dope in my trap
Watch that boy hit your spine
I just fucked that nigga bitch
[?] couple [?] in my roof so she know I'm with the shits
I'm a fuck her in the whip
Fuck her in the whip
Cause she waitin' in the whip

You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
Cause it get cold like Minnesota, cold like Minnesota
Cold like Minnesota, cold like Minnesota
Need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
Cause it get cold like Minnesota, cold like Minnesota
Cold like Minnesota, it get cold like Minnesota
Need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
