[Verse 1:]
These bitches can't leave me alone
I swear I had to get me a new number, I copped me like 2 or 3 phones
And when I drop diamond, I swear it's my summer
I'm rockin' all white a V lone
I jump in the Hummer, skurt off with your mama
That bitch was all in my home
She suckin' the clique, fuck every for commas
Don't let me get into my zone
And if you do that, I swear you in trouble
I feel like I am alone, cause you not my brother then I cannot trust you
These bitches, they choosin' the most
You don't got no money then I don't even want you
My bands got up over night, I'm fuckin' bitches, get money in all that muthafucka

[Verse 2:]
We winnin', we winnin', we winnin', whoever doubt us, well we winnin'
For K on my channel pretendin', you kiss on her lip with my dick when she kissin'
Said hunnids, no limit, no limit, got Master P money, bitch don't got a limit
Said hunnids, no limit, no limit, got Master P money, bitch don't got a limit
I need that table and 87, AK with that MAC-11
Fuccboi bad then count his blessin', kill 'em all and leave you on a streaker
Pencil this shit and learn your lesson, my gun hold like 47
Put 3 so you know my big gun we will knock down mount everest
