[Chorus - Lil Uzi Vert:]
Don't be rude
Like my bitches to come in twos
That's my rule
You's a fool
If you think that yo' boo
Wasn't stuck to me like glue
Don't rock Jays
Okay I might rock ones
Okay don't rock two's
Who's those dudes?
Okay that's my goons
When I say they shoot
Shoot
[x2]

[Verse - Lil Uzi Vert:]
Alotta money that's all in my pocket (uh)
Goyard that's all on my wallet (uh)
Money can't fit in my pocket (Damn)
She suckin' me off I got knowledge
Boy you will go blind
If you look straight at my diamonds
Yea I been fly
Bitch you just came perfect timing
I get so High
I get so high
I get so high
I don't know why
I don't know why
I don't know why
I get so high
I don't know
Yeah

[Chorus - Lil Uzi Vert:]
Don't be rude
Like my bitches to come in twos
That's my rule
You's a fool
If you think that yo' boo
Wasn't stuck to me like glue
Don't rock Jays
Okay I might rock ones
Okay don't rock two's
Who's those dudes?
Okay that's my goons
When I say they shoot
Shoot
