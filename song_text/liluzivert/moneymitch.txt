Yeahx8 (what?) Yeah
All your jewelry look funny
All your bitches look funny
All your money look funny
No big face hundreds
No bitch say nothing
Yeah, Lil Uzi, sixteen hundred
Crib look like the playboy mansion got sixteen bunnies
I'm the lover, yeah, do what I wanna
Don't cop from that nigga right there he is a undie
Remember they ain't love me now these girls wanna hug me
Only said that cause they boyfriends listenin'
But these girls wanna fuck me

Got the rari, saw the Wraith, running
Run it, Run it, Run it, Run it
Now I'm on top of them game remember I was nothing
If I talk to your girl, Man I swear you lucky
Oh, swim in it, oh, let me touch it
Turn around girl let me bust it
Running back, running back, rush it
In Atlanta, like I'm TJ Duckett
Dior suit, take the arm and I cuff it
Trap snow off for nothing, run up and they bust it
Take xans til I stumble, full bars now I punt em
Look she brung her friends they wanna tumble
Talk to mines in the huddle
All my niggas some savages you could leave em in the jungle
You could leave em in the desert
They some dogs need a muzzle
Baby girl turn around, I do not wanna cuddle
Damn you wet like a puddle, said you wet like a puddle
And I'm feeling myself, on a molly and a other one
Now your life is ahead of you, no one is ahead of you
Mike Tyson I'm impeccable, man I swear that's what this bread'll do
I swear that's what this bread'll do, (money money)
She took me in the backroom said see what this head'll do
Run it, Run it, bitch run it

Hundred thousand in jewelry told my jeweler run it
Why you keep talking bout money
Boy you ain't got no money
Why you keep on sneak dissing
Boy I am not no dummy

Got a white bitch her name Connie
Slide in the lamb like a Johnny
In LA TMZ run up on me, kicking the cam like karate
In a Porsche, she in a Mazi'
She got pictures of me while its sleep
Said she want fifteen thousand
Run it, run it, run it, run it
Once I pay that money, lil bitch you is a done one
Big gun like I'm huntin', my cousin was chopping them onions
Move that shit straight out the oven
Went on the block made a hundred
Went on the block made a hundred
Hundred thousand, all of my niggas they wilding
I'm a Vlone thug, that's why I'm stylish
My main girl I swear that she in college
She give me brain that's how I get knowledge
In that studio rocking that Alex
Smokin' gas got me high like a pilot
Man that girl she work at Follies
Man that girl she work at Magic City
The girl at follies she got the titties
The girl at Magic she got the body
On the real neither one of them fifty
Neither one of these girls get me, yuh
They only with me cause I got these hundreds and fifties
Lil Uzi don't move with no twenties
Funny thing is you really don't move with money
You still move with them tens and them fives
You still move with those nickels and dimes
You took that girl to meet your mom
But I fucked that girl right on the come
Put them girls all in a line, boy, I'm not lyin'
Please do not get out of line, I'm a leo like lion
Huh, run it, run it, bitch run it, yeah

Hundred thousand in jewelry told my jeweler run it
Why you keep talking bout money
Boy you ain't got no money
Why you keep sneak dissing
Boy I am not no dummy (no)
Got the 'rari, saw the Wraith, run it
Run it, run it, run it
