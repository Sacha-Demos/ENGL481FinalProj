Why you walk so cool aye, thousand dollar shoes aye
Hunnid on my jewels aye, I got all these groupies

[Verse 1 - Lil Uzi:]
Fucked that bitch on Monday, fuck her sister Tuesday
You is not gon' do a thing, with my squad like Wu-Tang aye

Let a lil nigga try us
Hit a nigga with a truck

Brittney turned me to a slut [x3]
Hit the bitch all on her back aye, Never put it in her butt aye
Put that shit all in her pussy aye, leave that shit all in her gut aye

Sometimes fear of God aye

I feel like I'm Dro aye, car ain't got no roof aye
That bitch kinda cute aye, blow me like a flute aye
Diamonds dripping they so wet, I gotta wipe my jewels aye
I can't wife no fool aye, got no time for mood swings
Spent like 50 on the ring and I bought two rings
Remember that bitch ain't want fuck me
Now that bitch wanna just fuck me
Remember that bitch said I'm dusty
Look at that hoe like you ugly aye
Your man ain't got no money aye
I just be smoking the dope, Skeme be smoking the clove
My brother whipping the stove
Jump in the crowd at my show, fucked the bitch in the front row

[Hook - Lil Uzi:]

Hoetel party for these bad hoes
For these bad hoes, that trip
