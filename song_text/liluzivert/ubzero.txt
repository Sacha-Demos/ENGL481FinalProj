[Hook:]
Break it down to a half, to a whole
Chain on, sub zero
Look at my bank, doing zeros
Behind that one, that two, that three zero-zero-zeros
Break it down to a half, to a whole
Chain on, sub zero
Look at my bank, doing zeros
Behind that one, that two, that three zero-zero-zeros

[Refrain:]
Chain on, sub zero
Look at my bank, doing zeros
Behind that one, that two, that three zero-zero-zeros
Counting my dineros, yuh
In the mob yeah like I'm Robert De Niro
Pull out that Porsche and that 'Rari
Cruising then I pull out Camaro
Look at your girl, looking at me like a hero
She play my dick like that shit Guitar Hero
Racks all the way to the bone marrow

[Bridge:]
I believe I can fly
You know I ain't scared to die
No way, no way

[Refrain:]
Chain on, sub zero
Look at my bank, doing zeros
Behind that one, that two, that three zero-zero-zeros
Counting my dineros, yuh
In the mob yeah like I'm Robert De Niro
Pull out that Porsche and that 'Rari
Crusing then I pull out Camaro
Look at your girl, looking at me like a hero
She play my dick like that shit Guitar Hero
Racks all way to the bone marrow

[Verse:]
Pull up right there in that hummer
Diamonds they shining like the summer
Getting money, eating my eggs extra runny
Ay, little girl you can not cuff me
Now I be counting my money
All of my haters, I love it
All of my haters, I love it
All of my haters, I love it
All of my haters, I love it
What you know bout it ain't country
Getting that work out the country
Moving that work in the dungeon
Fuck that bitch once, she a dungeon
Hit from the front and she love it
Hit from the back and I'm cumming
And I just laugh at the money
I really turned into something
Counting up paper, I'm thumbing
Count up blue notes and I'm thumbing
(What? You broke boy)

[Hook:]
Break it down to a half, to a whole
Chain on, sub zero
Look at my bank, doing zeros
Behind that one, that two, that three zero-zero-zeros
Break it down to a half, to a whole
Chain on, sub zero
Look at my bank, doing zeros
Behind that one, that two, that three zero-zero-zeros

[Outro:]
Behind that one, that two, that three zero-zero-zeros
Behind that one, that two, that three zero-zero-zeros
Behind that one, that two, that three zero-zero-zeros
Behind that one, that two, that three zero-zero-zeros
Behind that one, that two, that three zero-zero-zeros
Behind that one, that two, that three zero-zero-zeros
Behind that one, that two, that three zero-zero-zeros
Behind that one, that two, that three zero-zero-zeros
