[Intro]

[Hook x2:]
Got so much money, I'm a flexer
Need me some money, so I'm a finesse ya
One hunnit hondo, nigga catch up
Now ya bitch want me, get ya checks up
Got so much money
I'm a flexer
Need me some money, so I'm a finesse ya
One hunnit hondo, nigga catch up
Now ya bitch want me, get ya checks up

[Verse 1:]
I'm getting money, not a stressor
If ya bitch on me, I'm a F her
Put her on my squad, they gone stretch her
Nigga ain't stupid, If he try test us
Cause we got them uzi's, all them techs
We got extendo's, bruh you get wet up
We got them things now that'll stretch ya
We don't do body, aim at yo neck
Count money photos, that's a no no
Cause if you owe bro you catch this fofo (44 caliber)
Count money photos, that's a no no
Cause if you owe bro you catch this fofo (44 caliber)

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
Paper don't fold now, got bank roll now
Rock yellow gold now, that shit old now
Platinum my rollie, need like four now
Making me millions, that's my goal now
Say you ain't know me, why you jaw me
Running through hit hoes, that don't owe me
Say you ain't know me, why you jaw me
Running through hit hoes, that don't owe me
