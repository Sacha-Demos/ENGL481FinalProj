[Hook - Lil Yachty:]
Drip, drip, drip, drip, drippin
Bitch I'm drip, drip, drip, drip, drippin
Bitch I'm drip, drip, drip, drip, drippin
Bitch I'm drip, drip, drip, drip, drippin

[Verse 1 - 21 Savage:]
Drippin on these niggas, drip drop
It's a real rollie it don't tick tock
Savage ridin' round the city with that Glock
Get that dick on it, I'm a let it pop
Let it pop, bitch you better run
It ain't no fun, when young Savage got the gun
I drop bombs on these niggas like Osama
Keep the Don Cannon I don't want no drama

[Hook - Lil Yachty:]
Drip, drip, drip, drip, drippin
Bitch I'm drip, drip, drip, drip, drippin
Bitch I'm drip, drip, drip, drip, drippin
Bitch I'm drip, drip, drip, drip, drippin

[Verse 2 - Lil Yachty:]
Flyest nigga you ever seen, I'm the king of the team
Hydro codeines, caught serving beans to the fiends
My new bitch Billy Jean, old bitch Tina Turner, keep the burner
Old hunnids Tom Joyner, my new bitch is a foreigner
My new wrist cost a 36, that's a quarter brick or three shows
I cut the ice on ear lobes, I'd rather split it with my bros

[Hook - Lil Yachty:]
Drip, drip, drip, drip, drippin
Bitch I'm drip, drip, drip, drip, drippin
Bitch I'm drip, drip, drip, drip, drippin
Bitch I'm drip, drip, drip, drip, drippin

[Verse 3 - Sauce Walka:]
Little bitch I'm so sick, Saucin' like I'm a Saucealot
I got so much flavor nigga
Swear to God that I probably sent you somethin'
Ain't your mama my baby mama
Drippin sauce how I make the commas
Pulled everything out the bottle, red bottle [?]
When I walk off it's a murder scene
Rolls got my wrist it look Burgundy
I made your bitch buy a fur for me
It wasn't even cold, hell it was spring
Sauce-Ebola, epidemic got the world drippin' over
Thanks to Sauce harbor now I'm on a little boat with 21 soldiers

[Hook - Lil Yachty:]
Drip, drip, drip, drip, drippin
Bitch I'm drip, drip, drip, drip, drippin
Bitch I'm drip, drip, drip, drip, drippin
Bitch I'm drip, drip, drip, drip, drippin
