[Lil Boat:]
Brrr hey RD man, it's Boat, yeah. Hey man you know that nigga Yachty went on the God damn mornin' show, niggas try to freestyle, niggas tryna act like a nigga ain't got it. Like a nigga ain't still got it, like a nigga ain't really countin' up hundred dollar bills. That motherfuckin' there like ain't bossed up bitch

[Lil Yachty:]
Stop all that flexin'
Woke up all my niggas like stop all that restin'
Might have my OG comin' do a little pressy
You niggas is pussy
I see it, I feel it, I know it, I smell it, it's clear
Fuck I look like sippin' beer?
I got 32 bitches back home waitin' on me
Give 32 fucks to a nigga hatin' on me
Got so much ice you'd think my jeweler flaked on me, God damn
Hold on, money so old, check its colon
Knot so fat Ben Franklin like who is you foldin'
Whips so new got these coppers thinkin' it's stolen
So they pull me over and see that my teeth golden
It's over, Bro keep the chopper on his shoulder
Just paid cash for a Benz, and Moms, a new Rover
Still the youngest nigga sober
Still the richest nigga over on my side of town
I'm still the king with the crown
King of the teens
Show some respect in my down
Nigga talkin' crazy, he get shot down
Ay, oh, yeah, ay, ah
How many times I'm a tell ya?
Young nigga I told ya, I told ya, I told ya
I told ya that RD up next
I told you that Boat keep a check
That Yachty could flex, lil bitch
Watch how I flip it
These niggas mad cause that wait, I just skipped it
Overnight shawty, that pussy, I dipped it
I had to slow it down cause niggas don't get it
Watch how I do it and watch how I did it
Just copped a new watch and oh boy have I shitted
Richer than ever
More wise and more clever
Ball so hard I need a letter, put that on my sweater
Lil bitch, lil bitch
Lil nigga you hate how I switched
26 shit, I jumped out on my wrist
I'm the richest out the group just like Kris Jenner
All of these niggas beginners
Fuck on that bitch then I skirt off with spinners in spinners
All of my whips got spinners
JBan$, JBan$, Lil Boat, Lil Boat

[JBan$2Turnt:]
Bitch Stop all that flexin'
Spent 10 on my neck, name dropping'? we pressing
Bitch don't want no pressure
Eat pussy for breakfast
That bitch actin' reckless, drop her off in Texas
My plug he like Messi
Got bricks out like sushi, nigga you a rookie
Empire, no Cookie
Saw his chain and I took it
Catch you off in traffic, bitch don't want no static
Then don't play like Magic lil bitch
I ball like I'm Kobe but it's 20, Ginobili
My niggas not foldin', talk down, cut you open
My neck is on frozen, Olaf
He put diamonds forever
We shinin', JBan$, he might blind ya, bitch
Talk down and we find ya, bitch
JBan$ keep that iron, bitch
October 30th Like Mike Meyers, bitch
G-wagon sit on the big tires, bitch
Bitch, bitch, JBan$

[Byou:]
(Never, never, never, never)
Never ate the box like RD and Jimmy
I shoot with the semi, went high like I'm 30
I look out the scope, just give me the scoop
Whenever you ready, his chest like spaghetti
That nigga gon' fold just like a futon
Would tell her jump on my dick but it's too long
I just bought a bunch of groupies with Groupon
Tell me what you want?
I told 'em, I told 'em, I told 'em
Hey, hey, I told 'em, I told 'em
Hey, I keep the chrome in my jeans
Hey, just like a chromosome
Hey, popped it with calicorn
Hey, when I get on, I'm a fuck me a capricorn
Hey, you a, byou a, ah, ah

[BigBruthaChubba:]
CHUBBA!
All of my whips got spinners
Chop the brick in half like it's the winter, December
Put ah nigga in a blender
All these niggas be pretenders
Pretendin', pretendin'
These niggas ain't winnin'
We still on that mission to get all the blue cheese
We got them clips just like a movie
She suck me up just like a smoothie

[Lil Yachty:]
Pussy so gooey, she lick me up after she do me
It's Boat from the Sixer, I'm cut like some sizzors
I'm gone off the sizzurp, I hit her from the back
Then hit on that back like she bizzurp
Eat on that pussy like it was some desert
Minister, sailing team, take him to chizzurch
I don't fuck with these niggas, these niggas be snitches
They just want my riches, they just wanna fuck on my bitches
These niggas, they can't
These niggas be jank
I might pull up with sword like I was Link
Pull up with a sword like 21
Hit the strip club and throw Bands just for fun
Lil Boat
