Man today's a good day
Cause I'm rich, rich, rich, rich
Walking down the street and I just copped a big booty bitch
Man today's a good day
Cause I'm rich, rich, rich, rich
And these diamonds on my wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist
Man today's a good day
Cause I'm rich

Today I don't have any haters
Cause I could care less what they saying
Cause I'm having a good day
I just check my bank account and there's so many O's
I couldn't give a mother fuck about any these hoes
Cause I am rich, rich, rich, I'm rich
I couldn't give a fuck about a bitch to be honest
Oh and no, I just sold a show
Park my car in the wrong spot but it still ain't get towed

Cause I'm rich, rich, rich, rich
Walking down the street and I just copped a big booty bitch
Man today's a good day
Cause I'm rich, rich, rich, rich
And these diamonds on my wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist
Man today's a good day
Cause I'm rich

[Skippa Da Flippa:]
Mo' money mo' problems
But I cherish every moment cause I came from the bottom
Cop mom's a coupé cause my bank so colossal
Me and Yachty on a yacht we pop a hunnid bottles
And I'm rich ya bitch
Catch me in the Fisker going crazy as I change the gears to 6
Every days a good day only if you're living rich
Holding blue hunnids a hella good mix
I feel good today I might cop a sting-ray
I love to get paid and she watch me blu ray
I got 5 different hoes so get money 5 different ways
Almost 24 hours and grind 7 days
Flippa!

Cause I'm rich, rich, rich, rich
Walking down the street and I just copped a big booty bitch
Man today's a good day
Cause I'm rich, rich, rich, rich
And these diamonds on my wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist
Man today's a good day
Cause I'm rich
