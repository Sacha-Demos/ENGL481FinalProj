[Intro:]
Lil Boat
Lil Boat
Just wait, they all gon see
You gon see
Just wait, they all gon see
You gon see

[Chorus:]
You gon see
All them hating on me
You gon see
Just wait, they all gon see
You gon see
All those who hated on me
You gon see
You gon see
You gon see

[Verse:]
I make that price of family
Got visions and I won't stop until a nigga kill me
22 brothers back home and they need me
Got... I don't want her, they say Lil Boat be scheming
Never take bitches with me on the road
Pick them hoes up as we go
I thought that you know, thought that you knew
Went to a yacht from a lil small canoe
I make it look so easy
That's why they wanna be me, woah
They wanna be me
I remember when they used to laugh at Boat
That's why I don't listen to nobody, no
Never spend guap on no bitch or no ho
I remember when they told me, Boat you can do it
I told them folks, sit back and watch me pursue it

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
You gon see
I know you gon see
Oh, you gon see, woah woah
Lil Boat, Lil Boat
Burberry and Boat
