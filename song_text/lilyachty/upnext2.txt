[Lil Yachty:]
You know what I'm saying nigga
Its a young nigga know what I'm saying
Nigga gon' act like they don't see a young nigga
These niggas see a young nigga
These bitches see a young nigga
Nigga shine, nigga flashing you feel me
My nigga E up in this bitch you feel me
What's popping niggas know what's going on nigga
Nigga talking about comma, you don't want a problem

Boat boy just copped him some diamonds
She gon' suck my dick cause she like how I'm rhyming
Its all about timing
Got 22 bitches on standby they fuck when I say so
Can't talk 'til my case close
I'm hot like a pepper, don't ash it
My coupe bitches basketball leather
Which nigga you rather it better be me
Maison Margiela with my black tee
Can't fuck with these niggas and all they rap beef
Got a tec 400, I'm feeling like money
My mouth looking sunny, these nigga look funny
So I keep the chopper
I'm know these niggas hope that I flop
I'mma flop in that pussy
It better be gushy, it better be heartless
Me and K Preme beat your ass with our bare fist
When I get her I'mma fuck me an heiress

[BigBruthaChuba:]
24 karat that'll fuck up my teeth
Pussy so wet that it fuck up the sheets
Catch me  posted right there on the street
Pocket rocket right under the seat
Wish a pussy nigga would try me
In the kitchen whipping up the heat
Catch purp get his ass beat
Smoking purp and then I ash it
50 band jugg then I cash it
Fucking your hoe then i pas it
Purple and lean that my passion
Make it disappear like its magic
Don't come to eh 6 where its tragic
Bricks wrapped up in elastic
In Europe with a bad bitch
And all we smoke is that cabbage

[Byou:]
I'mma hot box the drop top, now the coupe look like a crock pot
Old school cubes in my ear, damn they looking like Macintosh
Flyer than an albatross, rims chopped like applesauce
I don't pay the pussy what it cost
Diamonds look like tear drops
Play with squares like hop scotch
Rims so up on the rim
No and 1 but and 1 of you niggas cross me I'm up in it
Dump in it, huh
I'mma catch a body like a cheerleader
I'mma die fly like Aaliyah
RIP I'll see ya when I see ya
40 thousand dollars on the coat
It ain't even cold I'mma call PETA
Whip it up with the eggbeater
Hoping don't want a sneaker
Another band on the other shoe like a nigga on house arrest
Chop hit you decompress, raising bars like bench press
Had to get the shit up off my chest

[Lil Yachty:]
Had to get this shit up off my chest
7 shot you might need a vest
26 for a nigga neck
Water diamonds jeweler straight from Fiji
When I'm on my money I look like a tiki
If you got a problem nigga don't you tweet me
I'm a real nigga Lil Boat don't do Hilfiger
15 hundred for a still picture
Saint Laurent nigga these ain't Jordans
Crib fill of clothes like I'm hoarding
In the air while you niggas boarding
If the cake right I'mma sitck a fork in

That damn Lil Boat, he's something else I tell
Ya that Digital Nas something else too
Well, I guess uh, we gon' holla at Yachty a lil bit
He's more emotional you'll see what I'm talking about
