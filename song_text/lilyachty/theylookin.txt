I see him lookin, she lookin
I see them lookin, they lookin
I see her lookin, he lookin
All the hoes lookin at Yachty
I see her lookin, he lookin
I see him lookin, hate lookin
I see her lookin, she lookin
All them boys wanna be Yachty

All them boys wannabe yachty
I kick like karate my ice is on freeze
24 karat the gold on my mouth
It's so shiny that shit look like cheese
Before she suck me and fuck me everytime I swear to god she sayin please
I put that bitch on her knees
Shout out my nigga Dior
Christian Dior on my back
When I'm fuckin these hoes I got gas in my pores
Lil boat I'm runnin for mayor
Flex with the chop in Decatur
I fuck her now fuck her later
Young nigga crispy like tatters
You a fry I'm a potato
You my son like you steve nash

I see him lookin, she lookin
I see them lookin, they lookin
I see her lookin, he lookin
All the hoes lookin at Yachty
I see her lookin, he lookin
I see him lookin, hate lookin
I see him lookin, he lookin
All them boys wanna be Yachty

Been had the braids in my head
Bitch they used to be black
They was callin me Rocky
So I went and dyed em red
Red dot to his head
And its still fuck the feds
Rick Owens on my legs
Tatted my arms and my body
Cool at the crib with the shotty
If a nigga want to try me
Shit on that boy like a potty
Lil boat I'm a hot commodity
I take a piss on yo property
I give a fuck if you rock with me
I run the youth ain't no stoppin me
Post on the block with my Glock on me
And I count up like the clock on me

I see him lookin, she lookin
I see them lookin, they lookin
I see her lookin, he lookin
All the hoes lookin at Yachty
I see her lookin, he lookin
I see him lookin, hate lookin
I see him lookin, he lookin
All them boys wanna be Yachty
