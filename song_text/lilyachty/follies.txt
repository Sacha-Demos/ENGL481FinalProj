[Lil Yachty:]
Every single night I like to fuck on the thotty
Ice on my wrist like a nigga play hockey
I'm ballin on these niggas, that's why all these hoes jock me
I just want to spend every dollar at Follies
I said I just want to spend every dollar at Follies
Every single night I like to fuck on the thotty
Ice on my wrist like a nigga play hockey
I just want to spend every dollar at Follies

I said I just bought a coupe and It's made by Cavalli
Fuckin' on my bitch and you know she a hottie
I just bought a new whip and it go fast like I'm Harley
Choppa get to singin' and it sound like Charlie
Yeah, yeah, Uncle Charlie, yeah, mmm

I got white on my blunt like a piano key

Stack up just to flex up, I'ma spend it all at Follies

Every single night I like to fuck on the thotty
Ice on my wrist like a nigga play hockey
I'm ballin on these niggas, that's why all these hoes jock me
I just want to spend every dollar at Follies
I said I just want to spend every dollar at Follies
Every single night I like to fuck on the thotty
Ice on my wrist like a nigga play hockey
I just want to spend every dollar at Follies
