Lean still get it for the guts though
Young hot head man cut throat
[?] on don't go
Kick back and sell out them O's
Uh
Skr, skr, skrt, skrt
Uh, skrt, uh, skrt
Uh, uh
Skrt, skrt

(Plug)
Pull up on your block and we squirting nines
Niggas wanna duke it this the right time
Counting up, counting up hella bands
Using my guap as a face fan
KSupreme, that's my right hand
Niggas mobbing deep like a Taliban
Right now I'm a Harlem boy but Lil Yachty from Atlantastan
Stack the cheddar cheese on my night stand
If my money low then watch your life man
Lean still get it for the guts though
Young hot head man cutthroat
[?] on don't go
Kick back and serve out them O's
Niggas strapped up like Girbauds
I just hopped out on them fo's
(Plug)
Bloody bandana my bros
But cuzzy bandana my woes
Bought bank and I bang on fo's
All these fuck niggas is hoes
He better not knock on my door
I bust a cap in his throat
I put a dick in his hoe
I might just flip out them O's
[?]
Brought my niggas 'round your hoe
Let em run train on ya wife
We pass that pussy all night
Then we stack it tall as kites
Nigga try me that's his life

Hella O's

Money stacking tall like lego's
I been counting hella O's
Hella O's
Hella O's

Serving off O's
I could flip a brick
Hella O's, hella O's

Young RD counting hella O's

Big full Chevy boy check out the candy paint canary
Yellow diamonds in my pinky ring
(Plug)
20 band juug's I can buy
I can buy, I can buy

All these bitches love me like I'm Jesus
Old money same age as Regis
But that shit long like R.Kelly
Fuck round put shots in your belly
Told that hoe to meet me at the telly
I can never ever fold
RD be counting big O's

Money make her touch her toes
Money got me the hoes
Money got a nigga right

Money stacking tall like lego's

Serving off O's

Young RD counting hella O's
