Warning, warning, warning, the drama queen is in the building,
The drama queen is in the building
I'm not the one, I'm not the one

Everybody wanna talk about kim,
But ain't nothing soft about kim
Everything you walk about kim,
Through all that I've been
Picture me being broke and I can auction my pen, please
I ain't never worry about hens, they worry about me
But I ain't worry about them
I'd rather see them coughing up flem
Off with they heads, guillotine kim so it's off with they limbs
Why pop cork with my men
When I was up north in the pen, my fans wrote me
They said queen keep doing ya thing right songs so we can quote thee
The rest of ya'll we
See our downfall, so I don't come around y'all
Now I'm beyond rich, the spittin magician poof be gone bitch
Bitch couldn't walk a mile in my louboutins
Me against you that's asalan
Qb bout the bomb, taliban
Coming through the north trench, caliban
Bitch you was just a child of mine and I'm casey omma get off scott free
Sipping don pee on palm beach
Original og, my alonski
Break bread with the irs family
While these jamie hoes tryna get fancy
I live the life of a queen I'm royalty bitch 
Bow down kiss the ring, money, power, respect is the song I sing
All I see is dollar signs, all I hear is cha ching
Bow into your fears have u staring at a long gun…
Didn't realize you fucked with the wrong one

I'm not the one, I'm not the one
I'm not the one, I'm not the one…
