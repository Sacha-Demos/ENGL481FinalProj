Shit is all different now man
Back then, they used to pay homage
For pavin the way, for makin it easier
to do what they do now
But what they do now?
They run their mouth
But you know what?
Actions speak louder than words

[song from "Coming to America"]
She's your queen to be
A vision of perfection
An object of affection
to quench your royal fiiiire
Completely, free from infection
to be used at your discretion
Waiting only, for your DIRECTION!!
Your queen, to, beeeeeeeeee!

Queen, to be
A queen to be forever
to quench your royal fiiiire

[repeat 3X]
She's your queen to be
A queen to be forever
to quench your royal fiiiire

[Outro]
Young Big Mike the Ruler
Queen Bee Lil' Kim
Black motherfuckin Friday
The talkin is over ladies and gentlemen
Fendi roll them drums
