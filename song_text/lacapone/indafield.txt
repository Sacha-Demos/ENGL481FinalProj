[Hook x3 - L'A Capone:]
These niggas ain't really
In the field little folks
Going in for the kill

And I love when I'm off that pill [x3]
Can't change boy I'm to real

[Verse 1 - JusBlow:]
These niggas ain't really in the
Field like a slave in the field
Tote steel Glock 40 show a nigga
How it feel headshot faceshot we
Ain't showing no chill I'm to T'd
Mom said chill you ain't the only
Real nigga in the field got a couple
Real niggas in them cells CPDK nigga
Fuck 12 L'A gang we don't do no chit chat
Location on we can get that little red bone
She getting that Glock 40 on me no kickback
One false move you can get that I know
A couple real niggas that's fake no
Sympathy on the Glock but you know I'm
Safe they say they real but they talking
To the jakes no face no case I'm straight
I'll never eat stake with the fakes I'll
Never walk around with a 8 I'll never sell
My soul like a cake like a street light I
Gotta keep me a pole like a street light
I'm always on six o couple blocks up
Yeah that's the O (O-block L'A gang!)

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Edai600:]
These niggas ain't really in the field
JusBlow in the cut with the steal damn
I love when I'm off that pill headshot
When he caught that kill on L'A what I
Rap that's real saw me lacking you ain't
Clap that steal you don't even wanna pack
That steel tell the truth you a act ain't
Real ride through Six-O got the grips out
Gang banging like the bloods and the crips
Out got a call they said that the bricks out
Blasthisass in the cut make em flip out 22
And the 40 and the clip out all these pussy
Ass niggas tryna get clout double cup on the
Purp gotta sip out free 9 and 22 till they get
Out (Free 9 bitch!)

[Hook]
