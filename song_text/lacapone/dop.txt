Dope...dope..

All we got is crack
Fuck around, yo neck gettin' snap
My niggas in the trap, in the trap
Yea, we stay strapped

[Chorus:]
All we do is sell coke
All we do is sell dope
Kick in your front mother fuckin' door
Yea we need that cash
Yea we need that dough
Yea we came in, with an extra scope
All we love to do
All we love to do is sell dope
Catch me in the streets
And you know I'm selling dope
Your baby momma wanna fuck me
All up in her hole
I'm all up in her hole
She bout to get exposed

I'm doin' hits, I'm rockin' with the niggas
You fuck around, I'm pullin' on da triggas
Yo baby mama, she feelin' all on me
But i ain't wearing tommy
Got this Ralph Lauren on my mother f-ckin' body
You play with me, I really get about it
Its body to body close caskets for [?]
And all ya'll niggas know me, I'm a murder [?]
Plead the 5th when you see me
When I speak, step up in yo city
Nigga I'm not diddy
I got that 40 on my body
Fuck with me and I'm bout it
And none of ya'll niggas want it
Is you with it? killa?
All I love to do is take dope
Sell dope
Where the dope?
Kick yo front do'
And if yo momma home she gettin' smoke
I don't really give a f
Nigga know its really on
You play with me, I bring the gun
And nigga now its dawn
I put yo ass to sleep like 12am
Yo momma wanna fuck me, man I'm shootin' in the gym
[?] on the scene, its a scary site
Fuck around nigga, and I could end yo life
Chaos on the scene, chaos on the scene bitch
If you fuck around, bitch, I could end yo life quick
