[Verse 3 - L'A Capone:]
Bitch, bitch I'm from Steve Drive!

Round here you get deep fried
They be smoking quiet

When we come around bet you smell lots of lots of lots of loud!
I don't think niggas want gun smoke
I got pounds of loud and that good dope
I keep a couple blows by my ankle
And when the jakes come I gotta get low
And we doing hits out them rentals
I got the 40 all in his dentals
These niggas don't know what I been through
I guess suckin' dick what she into
I'ma do this shit for my kinfolk
Steve Drive shit, it's simple
You ain't tryna make cake, what you in for?
Keep playing with us, you gone be in for it
D-Block shit if you ain't know
Fuck a bankroll, I got rainbows
This flat got me feeling like Rambo
I don't wanna hit a nigga with a combo
These streets ain't shit but my jungle

And every one of my niggas gone rumble
I got a shooter with me, waddup Rondo
Bitch I'm from Steve Drive!

The side where it get crazy at
Bitch I'm from Steve Drive!
