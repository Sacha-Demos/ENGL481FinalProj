We don't tolerate bitch-ness
We don't, we don't tolerate bitch-ness
We don't tolerate bitch-ness
We don't, we don't tolerate bitch-ness
We don't tolerate bitch-ness
We don't, we don't tolerate bitch-ness
We don't tolerate bitch-ness
Sneak diss, bad for your fitness, you better

[JB Bin Laden:]
Up the jock on a nigga, make him back up
I'm just a young nigga trying to get my sack up
She want a sip of the lean, wanna act up
You can play it smart or get clapped up
I got spoon in the cut, load the mac up
Do a drill, peal off in the Straight 8
You can get erased, nigga we don't play it safe
We droppin rakes, bitch meet my nigga face
He done smoked a couple niggas, he'll beat the case
Don't fuck around kid, these niggas jakes
It's just bitch-ness, all these niggas fakes
A lot of bitch shit, all these niggas ways
In the trap, I ain't ate, sleep shit in days
I don't really give a fuck cuz I'm getting paid
Bad bitch, I'm [?] like braids
I be posted by the store, you can ask Ray
Smoke a nigga, put him out like an ashtray
Pretty bitch, fuck me good on a bad day
Wrong niggas be fake, they'll sneak hate
But acting like its all good in a mad way
I don't trip, I just hit him with the "Laugh" face
The "Fuck Y'all Niggas I'mma Cash" face
You can find me first place in a bag race
Cuz I ain't getting caught lacking in the last place
And we don't tolerate bitch-ness
Sneak diss, bad for your fitness, you better get this
Hit your block up, leave no witness
25 shots that's Christmas
Got a handful of niggas on hitlist
I made this here for the bitches, and the snitches, and the lames
L'A Gang, bitch!
