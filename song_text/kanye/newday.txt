[Kanye West:]
Yeah, uh
(Sun in the sky)
(You know how I feel)
Me and the RZA connect
(Breeze driftinâ on by)
Yeah, me and the RZA connect
(Breeze driftinâ on by)
(Itâs a new life for me)
(For me, for me)
(Oooh, oooh)
(And Iâm feelinâ good)

And Iâll never let my son have an ego
Heâll be nice to everyone, wherever we go
I mean, I might even make âem be Republican
So everybody know he love white people
And Iâll never let âem leave his college girlfriend
And get caught up with the groupies in the whirlwind
And Iâll never let âem ever hit the telethon
I mean even if people dyinâ and the world ends
See, I just want âim to have an easy life, not like Yeezy life
Just want âim to be someone people like
Donât want âim to be hated, all the time judged
Donât be like your daddy that would never budge
And Iâll never let âim ever hit a strip club
I learned the hard way, that ainât the place to get love
And Iâll never let his mom move to L.A.
Knowinâ she couldnât take the pressure, now we all pray

(Sun in the sky)
(You know how I feel)
(Breeze driftinâ on by)
(Breeze driftinâ on by)
(Itâs a new life for me)
Me and the RZA connect
(For me, for me)
Me and the RZA connect (Oooh, oooh)
(And Iâm feelinâ good)

[Jay-Z:]
Sorry junior, I already ruined ya
âCause you ainât even alive, paparazzi pursuinâ ya
Sins of a father make yoâ life ten times harder
I just wanna take ya to a barber
Bondinâ on charters, all the shit that I never did
Teach ya good values, so you cherish it
Took me 26 years to find my path
My only job is cuttinâ the time in half
So at 13 weâll have our first drink together
Black bar mitzvahs, mazel tov, mogul talk
Look a man dead in his eyes
So he know you talk truth when you speak it, give your word, keep it
And if the day comes I only see him on the weekend
I just pray we was in love on the night that we conceived him
Promise to never leave him even if his mama tweakinâ
Cause my dad left me and I promise never repeat him
Never repeat him, never repeat him

(Sun in the sky)
(You know how I feel)
(Breeze driftinâ on by)
(Breeze driftinâ on by)

(Itâs a new life for me)
(For me, for me)
(Oooh, oooh)
(And Iâm feelinâ good)

(Sun in the sky, you know how I feel)
(Breeze driftinâ on by, you know how I feel)
(Breeze driftinâ on by, you know how I feel)
(Itâs a new life for me)
(Itâs a new dawn, itâs a new day)
(Itâs a new life for me)
(Oooh, oooh)
(And Iâm feelinââ¦)
(Birds flyinâ high, you know how I feel)
