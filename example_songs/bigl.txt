And every year I gain clout and my name sprouts
Some brothers still be large if the crack never came out
I got the wild style always been a foul child
My guns go poom-poom and yo guns go pow-pow
Im known to have a hottie open I keep the shottie smokin
Front and get half the bones in your body broken
