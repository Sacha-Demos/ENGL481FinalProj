Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I fantasized about this back in Chicago
mercy, mercy me, that Murcielago
thatâs me, the first year that I blow
how you say broke in Spanish? Me no hablo
me drown sorrow in that Diablo
me found bravery in my bravado
DJâs need to listen to the modelâs
You ainât got no fuckinâ Yeezy in your Serrato?
(You ainât got no Yeezy, nigga?)
stupid, but what the fuck do I know?
Iâm just a Chi-town nigga with a nice flow
and my bitch in that new Phoebe Philo
so much head, I woke up to Sleepy Hollow

Can we get much higher? (higher, higher)
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Look like a fat booty Celine Dion
sex is on fire, Iâm the King of Leon-a Lewis
beyond the truest
hey, teacher, teacher
tell me how do you respond to students?
and refresh the page and restart the memory?
respark the soul and rebuild the energy?
we stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemies
sorry for the night demons still visit me
the plan was to drink until the pain over
but whatâs worse, the pain or the hangover?
fresh air, rolling down the window
too many Urkels on your team, thatâs why your wins low
donât make me pull the toys out, huh
donât make me pull the toys
and fire up the engines
and then they make noooise

Can we get much higher? (higher, higher)
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

At the mall there was a seance
just kids, no parents
then the sky filled with heron
(I saw the devil) In a Chrysler LeBaron
And the hell, it wouldnât spare us
(And the fires did declare us)
(But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress)
(And moved her back in Paris)

Can we get much higher? (higher, higher)
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Can we get much higher? (higher, higher)
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
