[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Fraud niggas, yâall niggas, thatâs that shit I donât like
Your shit, make believe, rapping âbout my own life
Thatâs rare nigga, Ric Flair nigga
The powerâs in my hair nigga, I get it, beat the chair nigga
SoHo, or Tribeca, three hoes, trifecta
Dope money, coke money, Hublot, my watch better
My penâs better, you donât write, trendsetter, you clone-like
Pay homage or Kâs vomit, ungrateful niggas, I donât like

[Hook: Chief Keef]
A fuck nigga, thatâs that shit I donât like
A snitch nigga, thatâs that shit I donât like
A bitch nigga, thatâs that shit I donât like
Sneak disser, thatâs that shit I donât like

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
They smile in my face is what I donât like
They steal your whole sound thatâs a soundbite
The media crucify me like they did Christ
They want to find me not breathinâ like they found Mike
A girlâll run her mouth only out of spite
But I never hit a woman never in my life
I was in too deep like Mekhi Phifer
In that pussy so deep I could have drowned twice
Rose gold Jesus piece with the brown ice
Eatinâ good, vegetarian with the brown rice
Girls kissinâ girls, cause itâs hot right?
But unless they use a strap-on then they not dykes
They ainât about that life, they ainât about that life
We hanginâ out that window itâs about to be a Suge night
Free Bump J, real nigga for life
Shoutout to Derrick Rose, man that nigga nice
Shout out to L-E-P, J Boogie right?
Chief Keef, King Louis, this is Chi, right?

[Hook: Chief Keef]
A fuck nigga, thatâs that shit I donât like
A snitch nigga, thatâs that shit I donât like
A bitch nigga, thatâs that shit I donât like
Sneak disser, thatâs that shit I donât like
Donât like, like, donât like, like
A snitch nigga, thatâs that shit I donât like

[Verse 3: Chief Keef]
Fake Gucci, thatâs that shit I donât like
Smokinâ on this dope, higher than a kite
This bitch gonâ love me now, she gonâ let me pipe
Screaming Sosa, thatâs that nigga that I like
I donât want relations, I just want one night
Cause a thirsty bitch, thatâs the shit that I donât like
I got tats up on my arm, cause this shit is life
And I spend on a bunch of clothes, cause Iâm livinâ life
I come up on the scene, and Iâm stealinâ light
bitch Iâm high off life, got me feelinâ right
bitch Iâm Chief Keef, fuck who donât like
And bitch we GBE, we just gonâ cite

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Big Sean]
We are not one and the same, nigga Iâm fuckinâ insane, fuck is you sayinâ?
Yo ass been doinâ the same, shit, not doinâ what you sayinâ
Dang, I told yo old bitch she was fuckinâ a lame, turn one ho to a train
Blow, blang, my niggas holdinâ that pain, I just hope you been praying
Bang bang, ridinâ for my niggas and thatâs for life
High class Iâm just surrounded by these low-lifes
And I run this bitch like itâs no lights
Goinâ hard the whole night cause I ainât goinâ back to my old life, I promise

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Jadakiss]
I done sold purple, I done sold white
Running outta work, thatâs that shit I donât like
She never let me hit it, she gave me dome twice
She blowinâ up my phone, thatâs that bitch I donât like
Nah, jean jacket with the sleeves cut
Put the pressure on âem just when they think that I eased up
Thirty for the Cuban, ânother 30 for the Jesus
Believe in ourselves when nobody else believed us, suckas

[Hook]
