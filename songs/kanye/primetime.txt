[Jay-Z:]
We in the time of our lives baby
Turn the music up, primetime

Yeah, primetime, beat by Dion, our third eon
Thatâs what the fuck we on
Moâ money, 40 year old phenom
My 15 minutes of fame has stretched beyond
At 42 be better than 24, I carried the 4-5, mastered 48 laws
Still wearing my 23âs they canât fuck with the boy
As far as them 16âs, Iâm 23 of it all
Primetime, riding that 6 deuce
That 9-11 I only subtract the roof
Started in 88â, got warm in 92â, I landed in 96â
Thatâs the year I came through
I hit the club, ordered some Grey Goose
Switched it for Ciroc to give Puffâs stock a boost
New money, I found the fountain of youth
Iâm headed to Miami to fuck up the Fontaine Bleu
A case of Ace, make it 2, nigga we rolling, beat the deuce
The night is young, what the fuck we gonâ do (ooh)

[Kanye West:]
The night is young, what the fuck you wanna do, huh
The night is young, what the fuck we gonâ do, huh
The night is young, what you really wanna do, huh

Primetime, basking in the lime
Cassius in his prime, coloring out of the line
Cause they donât want nobody thatâs colored out of the lines
So Iâm late as a motherfucker, colored people time
Damn Yeezy, they all gotta be dimes?
Well, Adam gave up a rib so mine better be prime
Niggas gonâ kill me, I swear they better be lying
I never live in fear, Iâm too out of my mind
Primetime, never hit these heights
I mean itâs like, itâs like our first 1st class flight
Iâm trippinâ on it, socks on marble floors
Iâm slippinâ on it, champagne, Iâm sippinâ on it
Shit taste different, donât it?
You know what, you right
Itâs like the best damn champagne I had in my life
âWhen you coming homeâ Thatâs a text from my wife
I told her, run a bubble bath
And float in that motherfucker like a hovercraft
And soak in that motherfucker til I call you back
I mean who says shit like that, and doesnât laugh (un-huh)

The night is young, what the fuck you wanna do, huh
The night is young, what the fuck we gonâ do, huh
The night is young, what you really wanna do, huh
