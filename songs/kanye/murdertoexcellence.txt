[Jay-Z:]
Bloody murder, murder murder [x4]

[Kanye West:]
The paper read murder, black on black murder
The paper read murder, black on black murder

[Jay-Z:]
This is to the memory of Danroy Henry
Too much enemy fire to catch a friendly
Strays from the same shade, nigga we on the same team
Giving you respect, I expect the same thing
All black everything, nigga you know my fresh code
Iâm out here fightinâ for you, donât increase my stress load
Niggas watchinâ the throne, very happy to be
Power to the people, when you see me, see you

[Kanye West:]
And Iâm from the murder capital, where they murder for capital
Heard about at least 3 killings this afternoon
Lookinâ at the news like damn I was just with him after school,
No shop class but half the school got a tool,
And I could die any day type attitude
Plus his little brother got shot reppinâ his avenue
Itâs time for us to stop and re-define black power
41 souls murdered in 50 hours

The paper read murder, black on black murder,
The paper read murder, black on black murder again
Murder againâ¦

Is it genocide?
Cause I can still hear his momma cry, know the family traumatized
Shots left holes in his face, bout piranha-size
The old pastor closed the cold casket
And said the church ainât got enough room for all the tombs
Itâs a war going on outside, we ainât safe from
I feel the pain in my city wherever I go
314 soldiers died in Iraq
509 died in Chicago

[Jay-Z:]
I arrived on the day Fred Hampton died
Real niggas just multiply
And they say by 21 I was supposed to die
So Iâm out here celebratinâ my post demise
If you put crabs in a barrel to insure your survival
You gonâ end up pulling down niggas that look just like you
What up blood? What up cos?
Itâs all black, I love us

[Kanye West:]
The paper read murder, black on black murder,
The paper read murder, black on black murder again
Black on black murder again
Black on black murder again

[Jay-Z:]
Itâs a celebration of black excellence
Black tie, black Maybachs
Black excellence, opulence, decadence
Tuxes next to the president, Iâm present
I dress in Dries and other boutique stores in Paris
In sheepskin coats, I silence the lamb
Do you know who I am Clarice?
No cheap cologne whenever I âshh-shhâ
Success never smelled so sweet, I stink of success
The new black elite, they say my black card bear the mark of the beast
I repeat, my religion is the beat
My verse is like church, my Jesus piece, now please, domino, domino
Only spot a few blacks the higher I go
Whatâs up to Will, shoutout to O
That ainât enough, we gonâ need a million more
Kick in the door, Biggie flow
Iâm all dressed up with nowhere to go

[Kanye West:]
Yea itâs all messed up when itâs nowhere to go
So we wonât take the time out til we reach the T O P
From paroles to hold Gâs, sold keys, low keys
We like the promised land of the OGâs
In the past if you picture events like a black tie
Whatâs the last thing you expect to see, black guys
Whatâs the life expectancy for black guys?
The systemâs working effectively, thatâs why
Iâll be a real man, take care of your son
Every problem you had before this day is now done
New crib, watch a movie
Cause ainât nothinâ on the news but the blues
Hit the mall, pick up some Gucci
Now ainât nothinâ new but your shoes
Sunday morning, praise the Lord
You the girl that Jesus had been saving me for
So letâs savor this moment, and take it to the floor
Black excellence, truly yours
