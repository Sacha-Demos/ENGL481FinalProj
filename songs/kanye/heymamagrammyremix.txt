Last Night I Saw You In My Dreams, Now I Can't Wait To Go To Sleep.
Last Night I Saw You In My Dreams, Now I Can't Wait To Go To Sleep.
My M-m-m-m Mama

I Wanna Scream So Loud For You, Cuz Iâm So Proud Of You An A
Let Me Tell You What Iâm About To Do
Mama, You Know I Act A Fool But, I Promise You Iâm Goin Back To School An
I Appreciate What You Allowed For Me, An A

I Was Three Years Old, When You And I Moved To The Chi
Late December, Harsh Winter Gave Me A Cold
You Fixed Me Up Something That Was Good For My Soul
Famous Homemade Chicken Soup, Can I Have Another Bowl?
You Work Late Nights Just To Keep On The Lights
Mommy Got Me Training Wheels So I Could Keep On My Bike
And You Would Give Anything In This World
Michael Jackson Leather And A Glove, But Didnât Give Me A Curl
And You Never Put No Man Over Me
And I Love You For That Mommy Cant You See?
Seven Years Old, Caught You With Tears In Your Eyes

Cuz Somebody Cheatin, Telling You Lies, Then I Started To Cry
As We Knelt On The Kitchen Floor
I Said Mommy Imma Love You Till You Donât Hurt No More
And When Iâm Older, You Ain't Gotta Work No More
And Imma Get You That Mansion That We Couldnât Afford
See Youâre, Unbreakable, Unmistakable
Highly Capable, Lady Thatâs Makin Loot
A Livin Legend Too, Just Look At What Heaven Do
Send Us An Angel, And I Thank You

Mama, I Wanna Scream So Loud For You, Cuz Iâm So Proud Of You An A
Let Me Tell You What Iâm About To Do
Mama, You Know I Love You So An,
I Never Let You Go An I Wrote This Song Just So You Know No Matter When You Go

Last Night I Saw You In My Dreams, Now I Can't Wait To Go To Sleep.
Last Night I Saw You In My Dreams, Now I Can't Wait To Go To Sleep.
Last Night I Saw You In My Dreams, Now I Can't Wait To Go To Sleep.

This Life, Is All A Dream, An My Real Life Starts When I Go To Sleep.
My M-m-m-m Mama
