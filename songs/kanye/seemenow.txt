I know you see me now right now
(I know you see me now right now)
I know you see me now right now
(You see)
I know you see me now right now
(Right now)
I know you see me now right now

[Beyonce]
I got my suit and tie
And I donât know if yâall know
Well, maybe yâall do
Or maybe yâall donât
But I donât really care
Itâs how we on it all the time
So Iâma get my money
Letâs go

[Kanye West]
Now, Iâma need you to kill the hypocrisy
This is an aristocracy
Iâm Socrates, but my skin more chocolately
Whatâs up with who? Thatâs old news
Iâm in a speedboat, in my boat shoes
Huh? I swear my whole collectionâs so cool
I might walk in Nobu with no shoes
He just walked in Nobu like it was Whole Foods!
That nigga crazy, I told you!
Immature adult (uh huh), insecure asshole (what else?)
And if you fall on the concrete, thatâs yoâ ass fault
If you pass on a Kon beat, thatâs yoâ last fault
Get what you ask for, I swear thatâs yoâ ass, so
She got a big booty, but she couldnât drop that ass low
âTil you take yoâ last ho, and rope up all the cash flow
When you gettinâ money, they be all up on yoâ ass, yo
When you gettinâ money Kons donât let a nigga pass go
Straight to jail, yo, in a hell hole
Right next to Lucifer, tell âem I say hello
Ask him if Iâma be there soon and tell âim I said âHell, no!â
Yo, what you say when your people get out of jail, huh?

[Beyonce with Kanye West in brackets]
My niggas is home
I guess I got everything
Everything I want
(Lets go shopping dog, lets celebrate)
But I donât
No matter how good it gets
(Free Weezy though)
Itâll never be like before
No women in the crowd
Screaminâ and itâs loud
Doinâ things not allowed
And I swear itâs goinâ down right now
(You know what it is)
I know one thing, my mama would be proud
And you see me lookinâ up
âCause I know sheâs lookinâ down right now

[Charlie Wilson Chorus]
I know you see me now right now
(I know you see me now right now)
I know you see me now right now
(Right now, right now)
I know you see me now right now
(Right now)
I know you see me now right now

[Kanye West]
Pour the champagne, let your watch show
Shorty got a man watch, wrist look colossal
I admit my first watch was a Fossil
Now Iâm in the Louvre, lookinâ for fossils
Attention to detail is so uncanny
And the whipâs on the Sprewells, itâs so un-Camry
Somebody need to put us on camera
The world of Rollies and everyone families
Stay Jordan fresh, suits and Ferrariâs
Cute, your shorty watch Barneys, we at de Bonnyâs
End up at Marley, Georgi, and service from Sergio
Da Kine Lamborghini, the chain throw off the vertigo
I know the flow just hit a hellafied vertical
This the Christ year, last year was magic, thirty-two
Lyrically, canât none of yâall murder âYe
âCause yâall raps ainât got no vertebrae
I got styled last June and she heard of me
I killed the fur last Paris, raised the murder rate
First of all, we all know the beats is
Like a mix between Fergie and Jesus
Imagine the direction of this immaculate conception
Every one of His Majestyâs swim parties is paegantries
Cannonball off the diving board when I am board
All my homies GDâs, but I am lord
Rap god, Greek mythology
And this life too crazy to think logically
Hereâs something that you could use in analogy
My life is like a childâs illusions become reality

[Beyonce]
Now go get my throne
âCause I donât wanna stop
I just go in my zone
And Iâma make it hot
âTil itâs time to go
When itâs time to go
Where you tryna go?
You better act like you can see me now
(Exactly!)

[Charlie Wilson]
I know you see me now right now
(I know you see me now right now)
I know you see me now right now
(Right now, right now)
I know you see me now right now
(Right now)
I know you see me now right now

[Kanye West & Charlie Wilson]
I know you see me
I know you see me
I know you see me
Itâs like Iâm 3D
I know you see me now right now
(I know you see me now right now)
I know you see me now right now
(Right now, right now)
I know you see me now right now
(Right now)
I know you see me now right now
I know you see me
I know you see me
I know you see me
Itâs like Iâm 3D
I know you see me now right now
(I know you see me now right now)
I know you see me now right now
(Right now, right now)
I know you see me now right now
(Right now)
I know you see me now right now

[Kanye West Talking]
Hey, feel like one of those old R. Kelly joints, right?
I bet they put me back on the cover of Ebony now
I know Jet Magazine callinâ right now
You lookinâ good today, too
I like that
You got your new suit on
And she got the extra cute on
I know you thinkinâ âThis that Yeezy we all loveâ
Iâm back, baby
We back, baby!
Uncle Charlie, by the way
And Iâmma let you finish, but I got Beyonce on the track
Thatâs what it is
Black excellence, baby
We the elite
We the greatest in the world!
We the greatest in the world!
