[Intro]
Stutterinâ
Givinâem rest and makinâ love again
In my best I be the run again
And I have the man dem stutterinâ

[Hook]
Iâm getting this nigga in the morning
He gonâ think he been chiefin just too long when
He see me in the eveninâ
Want to catch all these feelin
Well let me be the first to get mine

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Ay yo, ay yo, barbeque and blow in the back of the crib
Sittinâand countinâ, smoking a spliff, this shitâs a gift
All my niggas watches is rough
Grabbing our crotches yelling ââWhat up?ââ
The jeans cost $500? Fuck
Stop it, keep baking, see, the smell itâs a statement
One freeze of this shit, you wonât feel your legs kid
Iâm a gangsta corporate hustla, my voice is illustrious
Hounded by vicious dons, nigga we armed, trust me bruh
They yellinâ Chef, kill the plate with the cooks
I say âYe with 2 Chainz on, we Common, letâs Push
Burn another bush, then burn another we brothers
Love us or not, the Mark Zuckerbergs of the block
Hug a knot, staying rich, we was built for the guap
Park the green six deuce on the deuce just props
Rock a kilt, mean Glock Iâm all machinery, ock
Cling to me, now see how the scenery rock yo?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Common]
I was born by a late chicken shack and a church
That mean the flow got wings and it come from the dirt
Golly, I know she wanna test the âRari
Eye on a dollar like Illuminati
Life is foggy, tryinâ to see through the mist of it
Could have been livinâ it, you was Mrs. Mischievous
This is just a letter to better your development
Situation delicate

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Some claim God body, blame Illuminati
All cause his pockets now knotty as his hair
Yeah
All Sonny no Cher, only solitaires
You clusterfucks could cluster up
On tippy-toe and still not muster up so its
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
In God we trust, the game is all us
Tilâ the sky calls or its flames on us
Push

[Hook]

[Verse 4: 2 Chainz]
2 Chainz
Iâm chillinâ in my camo, flippinâ through the channel
On my G.O.O.D. Music shit, my logoâs a Lambo (damn)
Four doors of ammo
Ammunition Iâm pitchinâ to make your body switch another position

[Verse 5: CyHi da Prynce]
I hope the people is listening
I could never sell my soul, I gave it back to God at my christening
Its tickelinâ when I hear what haters be whisperinâ
What makes you think an Illuminati would ever let some niggas in?
Fake friends and siblings, like to wish you well but ainât never flip the nickel in
Haters wanna pull they pistol when they see me in this race car
But you canât spell war without an A-R
15 I was pushing carts at K-Mart
By 21 they said Iâd be inside a graveyard
Canât wait to get that black American Express
So I can show them white folks how to really pull the race card

[Break: Dâbanj (Kanye West, Kid Cudi)]
Yeah, you feelinâ on top now, getting that money nigga?
(You sold your soul)
Yeah, you feelinâ on top now, getting that money nigga?
(You sold your soul)
Yeah, you feelinâ on top now, getting that money nigga?
(Naw man, mad people was frontinâ
Aw man, made something from nothing)

[Outro: Kanye West]
I treat the label like money from my shows
G.O.O.D. wouldâve been God except I added more oâs
If I knew she was cheatinâ Iâd stillâve bought her more clothes
âCause I was too busy with my Baltimore- you know
Some people call that the art of war you know
I guess it depends what you fallinâ for
The clothes, cars, money, girls and the clothes
Aw money, you sold your soul
Nah man, mad people was frontinâ
God damn, we made something from nothing
