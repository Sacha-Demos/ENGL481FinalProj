[Verse 2 Missy Elliott]

Hip hop betta wake up, the bed to make up 
Some of ya'll be faker than a dragon make-up
Got issues to take up before we break up
Like Electra let go miss Selida Baker
I love Jocob, the jury wont fix my place up
Gotta stay up, studio nice to cake up
Now check my flava, rich folks is now my neighbors
I got cable, now check it how i make my paper
Hip hop dont stop be my life saver
Like Kobe and Shaq if they left Lakers
And like a elevator dj on a cross fader
Black wake up i'll see yah ass later

[Chorus x1]

[Verse 3 Jay-Z (Missy Elliott)]

I need rims that dont listen and boomin system
First piece of change i see im gon' get one
745 no license to drive
I aint even gotta home i gots to live in my ride, fuck it
(Rewind)
I can hear myself but i cant feel myself
I wanna feel myself like Tweet
745 no license to drive
I aint even gotta home i gots to live in my ride, fuck it
Couple of karats in my ear wont hurt
Need a nice chain layin on this thousand $ shirt
Evisu Jeans cover the rectum, i kick game just like David Beckham
Anybody in my way i wet them
Ima be this way until the cops come catch em
To detective sketch em on the sidewalk wit chalk New Yorks infections
Till i got taught a lesson
Couple niggaz gone couple wink corrections
And Marie got 10, Tie got 15 nigga even my kin
Got 5 years bringin 19 in, i just think i used to think like them
Now they gotta live through the pictures that i send em in the pen
Hope you dont start yah life where i end

WAKE UP [x15]

[Chorus x1]
