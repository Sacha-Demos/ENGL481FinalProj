[Verse One:]

Bitches
I never wanna hang with bitches
Since I turn Missy
Every bitch I meet be booty lickin
My ass they kissin
But I feel like they way to picky
I use to know a guy name Ricky
Oh really?
Don't piss me off and
Son, better let ya'll know you lucky
Cause if I come out buckin
The whole world better be duckin
Cause I roll with Puffy
No Doubt
Shit turned out get lucky
No matter what you still love me
You whack, you buggin

[Chorus:]

Pass da blunts on the left hand side
Pass da blunts on the left hand side
We got the beats
You got the beats that make me jump, jump, jump
We got the beats
You got the beats that make me rocky dodi dum
Pass da blunts on the left hand side
Pass da blunts on the left hand side
I got the rhymes
I got the rhymes to make you jump, jump, jump
I got the rhymes 
I got the rhymes to make you rocky dodi dum

[Verse Two:]

Niggas
I always keep a good nigga
I get him for his figures
I A-K-A gold digga
See me with him
In a jewelry store
Buyin glitta
Should I not or should I?
I'm a get em, I'm a get em
Bitches
They mad cause I be flossin
Yeah this pussy costin
Tired and we tossin
You know I'm rockin
Cause there will be no stoppin
All that shit you poppin

[Chorus]

[Timbabland talking:]

Welcome y'all 
To Timbaland and Missy hit factory
A lot of people try and sneak in
And get the ingredients
But I am da man behind the ingredients
So please come to me with the recipe baby

[Verse Three:]

You see me on the videos
And then you want to go and play me on the stereo
Mic check 1-2-1-2
Here I go
My style is supa dupa fly and yours is so so
You see me on the videos
And then you want to go and play me on the stereo
Mic check 1-2-1-2
Here I go
My style is supa dupa fly and yours is so so
