The dance that you doing is dumb
How they do where you from
Stickin' out your tongue girl
But you know you're too young
A bunch of girls do it and the shit looks fun
That's how they do it where we from
You know it don't start till one
That's how they do it where they from

I'm so faded, no exaggeration
Backs breakin' like a perculation
Boys to the yard for some hip spankin'
Where you make it drop down it like you animated
Can't take it, them chicks been fakin'
Ya'll still sleep, better stay awakened
Hot new dance for the hood to make it
Make the dope move fast, make them think you drinkin'
Head to the floor don't collect that though
You better huddle up cause the beat's so cold
Pop that, pop that, cock and reload
This another hit, I got an ace in the hole
Boys on my back, playa did you peep that?
You got a small stack, playa, you can keep that
I'm a big mack, make you wanna eat that
Like m-m-m-m-m, yak it to the yak
Junk in the trunk make you pumps in the bump
Girls wanna have fun make you stickin' out your tongue

The dance that you doing is dumb
How they do where you from
Stickin' out your tongue girl
But you know you're too young
A bunch of girls do it and the shit looks fun
That's how they do it where we from
You know it don't start till one
That's how they do it where they from

[Pharrell:]
I come into this bitch like liquid
Drip, drip, then the business
Click, click, get the picture
Hermés, Trismegistus
Witness and get lifted
Basic, nigga I was born in the basement
Shape shift, nigga I think like a spaceship
False, oh-nah-nah-nah
I am so different than y'all
So far apart
The way that I balance the bars
I never fall
And if I do I just call
The almighty yellow star, God
Lyrically I'm Optimus Prime
Look how I drive, look at my ride
When I go by, smoke in your eyes
So open your eyes, the joke's on you guys
And you ain't gotta be a mason to see through
Some of this shit on occasion

The dance that you doing is dumb
How they do where you from
Stickin' out your tongue girl
But you know you're too young
A bunch of girls do it and the shit looks fun
That's how they do it where we from
You know it don't start till one
That's how they do it where they from

I'm like kak-a-rak-a-rak-rak-a-rak-a-rak
Make a new track, make 'em fall on they crack
Give 'em a slap, appetizer and smack
I'm so fat in the back, make the boys all collapse
Yeah when I rap they be all on my jack
Boys wanna jump on this pussy cat
Got a new idea, let me switch it
Man, I'm so futuristic
Big lips and big, big, big hips
Body be thick like a biscuit
I'm different, rippin' shit
Microphone grippin' it
Gettin' these Benjamins
New car, whippin' it
I'm so far ahead of y'all
Man I'm on top of the stars
I don't care none of y'all are
Blah-blah-blah-blah, you best to go rewrite your bars

Shawty what?
How they do it where you from?
How they do it where you from?
That's how they do it where we from
That how they do it where they from
Shawty what?
How they do it where you from?
How they do it where you from?
That's how they do it where we from
That how they do it where they from
