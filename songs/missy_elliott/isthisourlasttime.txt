[Missy Elliott]

Yeah!....OK!
Yall know how i do it
From old school rap to old school r&b
Yep thats me
We gon' do it one time like this
Oh...oh...come on

[Verse 1 Missy Elliott]

I remember when we first made love
It was so good
Nigga i was whipped n' all into it
Off of that good wood
And if i could i would persue it
But you wont let me do it
I like first time around wit playboy 
You keep puttin me down...umm
I cant keep runnin away, from you
But the sex dont feel the same, no no no
You dont hold me nore kiss me like, you used to
I can tell your feelins changed
It must be some other bitch thats takin up, your time
If it is then let me know, oooohh
So i wont call you over to taste a piece of this good pie
Why you dont fuck me like before

[Chorus]

I like the first time [X2]
I like the first time [X2]
I like the first time talkin bout the, second time
I like the first time [X2]
I like the first time [X2]
I like the first time talkin bout the, second time

[Verse 2 Missy Elliott]

I remember when we first, made love
It felt so good you made me cry, uhm uhm uhm
But now you just ruch to get it, over
And it dont feel like the first time

[Chorus x1]

[Verse 3 Fabolous]

Yeah you probly the first girl im sprung on im hung on the spots yeah
Put yah lips and tongue on you make me a fan
I took the cards that you dealt and made me a hand
Its the feelins that i felt that made me a man
Now im fightin to get it back like Mike Tyson
I wanna grab my helmet and ride but you took bike license
I just wanna do it like we did it before
Cindarella you was wit it before
Now i wanna bring a slipper, you act like you dont fit it nomore
Like i got it but i cant get it nomore
And i aint useually chaser cause i write wit my pencil
But also how to use my eraser
And at the present time i think about the past 
I think about yo ass and can i see it in the future
If i see you i'll salute yah
Cause for your lovin im a soldier, Mami i thought i told yah

[Missy Elliott]

Why you dogin me out
