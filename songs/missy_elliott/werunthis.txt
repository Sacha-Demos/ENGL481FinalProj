My style can’t be duplicated or recycled
This chick is a sick individual

Sick tape vol. 2
Believe it

Ho… Ho…

Let me switch up the game

[Verse 1]

I drink that cognac
Step back cause I might put it on ya
I go deep so deep till you sleep
Count sheep wake you from f***ing all week
You don’t to have to show ya
How freakish I act when im not sober
Whut up & tow up sho nuff
I ain’t scared to take it off (tell the freak to take it off)
Tipsy & I feel good (feel good)
Black dudes got big woods
Into I do it I dun it
If you really really want it then nigga stop frontin
Boy you know im your type (your type)
5’2 and wear my jeans real tight
My curves they swerve so superb
My word’s my word and I came to slurr it

[Chorus]

We run this (run this)
We run this (run this)
We run this (run this)
Oh, oh, oh,
It don’t matter where you  from it’s where you at
& if you came to freak-a-leak you better bring your hat
East coast, west coast, down south
Represent your coast
Yea we run it
Yea we run it
Yall don’t want it
Cause my coast run it
Oh
We run this s***
We run this s***

[Verse 2]

Wanna pull my hair
Break my back
Put it right money might sit in ya lap
Back to back you can’t even keep track
It’s a fact freaks like to get slap
Suck my toes & then a back rub
I don’t come to do it
I just wanna be touched
Look at how yall are makin me blush
got enough to go round ??
Wanna run that tush in a bush
Don’t my diamonds look real good
& they shine so hard that it glitters
Too many carats they look like critters
& we can do it all night
Take a flashlight you see up in my windpipe
I like the ? up in your height
I wanna know can you handle the might

[Chorus]

We run this (run this)
We run this (run this)
We run this (run this)
Oh, oh, oh,
It don’t matter where you  from it’s where you at
& if you came to freak-a-leak you better bring your hat
East coast, west coast, down south
Represent your coast
Yea we run it
Yea we run it
Yall don’t want it
Cause my coast run it
Oh
We run this s***
We run this s***

[Verse 3]

Any hustlas  in the party yall (hell yea)
If you a pimp let me see you party hard (hell yea)
Oh strippers take your clothes off (hell yea)
Yall superstars
You don’t need no bodyguards (hell yea)

I roll hard
a lot of rappers say I say im way too hard
Pull up to the club in a rental car
Where the freaks at
Them freaks at the bar
Where the hard the hard drinks are
Don’t start
You don’t want beef
Don’t take it that far
With a superstar
I got my foot on the clutch
See me bounce my butt
Misdemeanor too much
& I don’t give a f***

[Chorus]

We run this (run this)
We run this (run this)
We run this (run this)
Oh, oh, oh,
It don’t matter where you  from it’s where you at
& if you came to freak-a-leak you better bring your hat
We run this (run this)
We run this (run this)
We run this (run this)
Oh, oh, oh
Represent your coast
& act like you know
Know how to act before you step your two feet in the do’
