What Time Is It?

[Chorus:]
Tonight it's party time
It's party time tonight (Wat time is it)
Tonight it's party time 
It's party time tonight (Holla Holla)
Tonight It's party time
It's party time tonight (Cumadee)
Tonight it's party time
It's party time tonight

[Verse 1:]
A lot of hip hopers but yall just small talkers
Yall could risk gettin cut off like nick-a-bokers
Albums flop, yall better off playin soccer
Misdeameanor, my deaeanor me the club rocker
I flo froppa, keep my goodies in a locker
Not a artist ya ca but i;m a shotta-bock
Private stocker number 1 game talka
When i start it up there will be not one stoppa.
Walk around and get ur dome crack like a craka
Matta fact break your bones like a crab bracker
Neva slack up, rack up and leave ya fractured
On a curve, where ya work leave ya fractured
Haters all in my face, can u please bak up
Haters smilin in my face, u need 2 be nacked up
be jacked, call 4 bak up, cuz i smick smick smack ya 
Now tell me whos bada

[Chorus]

Tonight It's party time
It's party time tonight (Cumadee)
Tonight it's party time
It's party time tonight

[Verse 2:]
Most indiviuals swear they invisible
Guys think I'm more important then the supa bowl
Romanis is a ritual now pay me my resisual 
Cuz e'rday all day ya hear me on ur stereo
I'm innocent i fool 'em make the guys lose control
I'm in the studio droppin hits from my booty hole
Ya f-in moolio yall dont wanna test me yo
Cuz when I'm done rappin, I make ya hair look like coolio
Now please cool it yo, Mideameanor real pro yo-
[Record Noise]-Frek It Frek it-
Real pro yo, wit a [Record Noise]-Frek it ill flo
I kick down doors and rock mini shows
I put a tag on ur toe and call u John Doe
Missy da name and M.E. is my initials 
Forget about it like the world forgot about Sisqo
Take it 2 the club and bop, rock to the disco
Think ya outta know its about to get physical

[Chorus:]
Tonight its party time
Its party time tonight (Say what)
Tonight its party time 
Its party time tonight (What time is it)
